### Hi, I'm Kyle Thielk.


I'm a software developer based in Austin, Tx. You can find me on Twitter as [@KyleThielk](https://www.twitter.com/kylethielk), my open source projects on [Github](http://www.github.com/kylethielk) and my professional resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kyle-thielk/19/213/103). 

I became interested in software development when I created my first website ([The Planted Tank](http://www.plantedtank.net/)) and I started playing around with PHP and MySQL. I grew that website to over 650K uniques a month, purchased some others and sold them all in 2012.

I started my professional career developing backend Java systems and have been transitioning to the other side ever since. I'm currently consulting with a focus on native Android and iOS development. I'm always looking for the next exciting project to work on. [Get in Touch.](https://www.twitter.com/kylethielk).

This blog is generated by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/kylethielk/kylethielk.github.io). Ditch self hosted wordpress. You can thank me later.

I'm married with two french bulldogs and a baby girl on the way!
