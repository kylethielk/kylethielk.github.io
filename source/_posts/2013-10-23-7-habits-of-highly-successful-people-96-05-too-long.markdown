I understand that Stephen R. Covey is highy respected and I'm sure he rakes in $5,000+/hour consulting fees but really this book for me still falls into the 'self help' genre where most information is common sense and that which isn't can be found on any 'self help' blog for free.

That is not to say I do not agree with the underlying premise of each of the 7 habits. In fact Habit 1 ("Be Proactive") and 5 ("Seek first to understand, then to be understood") in particular I think we should all be mindful of every day. Habit 6 is titled "Synergize", Habit 7 is titled "Sharpen the Saw". No explanation is needed as to why 'fluff' is the first word that comes to mind.

This is how I imagine Covey's conversation with his publisher after coming up with the idea for the book.

Covey: "I have this great idea for a new book".
Publisher: "Excellent, how far along in the process are you?"
Covey: "Finished."
Publisher: "How long is it?"
Covey: "15 pages."
Publisher: "What? We can't sell a 15 page pamphlet for $19.99. Fluff it up!"

1 Month Later:

Covey: "Ok. The book is complete. Still 15 pages of good information, but now with 365 pages of fluff as an added bonus!"

Seriously read this [WikiBooks'' summary](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seven_Habits_Study_Guide/Quick_overview_of_the_seven_habits), and save yourself the time and money. Update: Even better read this [Forbes' Summary](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/07/24/the-only-thing-you-need-to-remember-about-the-seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people/).
