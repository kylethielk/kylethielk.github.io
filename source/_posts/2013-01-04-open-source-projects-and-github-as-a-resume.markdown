One of the primary functions for this blog is [accountability](http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/accountability/). So here it is today, my first publicly accountable goal: **Start contributing to and starting my own open source projects. **

Between time spent at the day job and my personal projects (that are not open) I have not previously contributed to a single open source project, or even considered it. This attitude has been selfish and harmful to myself at the same time. I use numerous open source projects daily without so much as a thank you to their contributors. I use [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Linux ](http://www.linux.org/)and many, many more daily. It is time I start contributing  instead of just taking. By contributing I will now be benefiting both the community that has provided so much for me as well as myself in the process.

The more forward thinking companies are now requiring your github account as part of your resume and for good reason. I thoroughly believe that a candidate's credentials for a programming job are more convincing when backed by historical code that anyone can examine and critique. Anyone who has ever hired will tell you that you cannot form a realistic opinion of an employee's skillset with a 4 hour interview. Real world work does not come in 4 hour spurts. Whats important is an employees performance on projects that last 6, 12, 18 months.

[Github ](http://www.github.com)is the perfect vehicle to demonstrate and sell your skillset. There are other but it is by far the most popular and widely used.  I use it daily for the day job so I am familiar with it. I have finally created my own personal [GitHub Account](https://github.com/kylethielk).

To start with I plan on getting my feet wet by contributing to smaller yet more active projects. From what I've read and heard, the larger projects are very unlikely to accept changes from unknown developers (me being one of those). Once comfortable and I have a few successful pull requests under my belt I can start with my own projects.
