Food. Varied, delicious food. This is what I will remember about Malaysia. The food courts (different than food courts we know in the US) are teeming with options. Indian, Chinese and Malay all simmer together to create a hodgepodge of deliciousness. Most dishes for under $2.

Our trip to Malaysia was short at just 2 weeks but we were able to cover quite a bit of ground. Â We started in Langkawi, headed to Penang, and finally crossed over to Malaysian Borneo (Kuching).

Langkawi was a beautiful island retreat, Penang a teeming city with more than enough options for the tourist, and Borneo was a nature lover's dream.
