I somehow missed the Tuesdays with Morrie bandwagon.  I had no idea how popular of a book it was (in fact I had never heard of it) when I found it as a cheap photocopied version in a Saigon book store.

I managed to pick it up for 50,000VND or $2USD, drawn in by the synopsis on the back cover.

The book relates Morrie's thoughts about life and death to the reader as told to the author in weekly conversations held on a Tuesday. As each week progresses you experience the decay of Morrie's body, but not mind due to ALS.

A different topic is covered in each week's conversation such as Faith, Forgiveness, Marriage, Family, and Death. The author was 16 years prior a student of Morrie's and only recently re-connected when he heard of his old professor's impending death.  Sprinkled between the conversations are personal excerpts from Morrie and the author's life both together and separate.

The book is extremely easy to read. Each chapter is only a few pages long and it is written in a manner that is very easy to comprehend.  The book certainly inspires one to think of many important issues in life such as our society's over reliance on materialism, the lack of personal connections and the general lack of compassion (and therefore happiness since we believe the two to be interconnected).

Unfortunately the book only barely scratches the surface of each topic and leaves you wanting more, much more.  Its only in the final pages of the book that the author admits that the entire time both himself and Morrie were having these conversations with the intent of writing a book.  It certainly makes you question the authenticity of the whole thing.

In the end it was an enjoyable read and certainly leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside albeit slightly disappointed.
