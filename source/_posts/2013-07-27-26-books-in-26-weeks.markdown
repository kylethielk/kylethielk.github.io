I hate reading. Rather, I _hated_ reading.

Something, somewhere has a sparked a passion for reading and now I actually want to do it. I even read a fiction...and liked it!

One of the many benefits of living and travelling internationally is an abundance of downtime. I plan on filing this downtime with books, lots and lots of books. The timing works out that I have right around 6 months  before resuming 'normal' life (not to say I don't plan on continuing to read voraciously, or even that travelling isn't a normal life).

Setting a goal is a good way to guarantee success and thus here it is: **26 Books in 26 Weeks**. That might not sound like a lot, but I'm pretty sure I haven't read that many books in my entire life (to completion).

<del>Each book read will be accompanied by its own post.  This will force me to actually 'read' each book (as opposed to my bad habit of skimming and thinking of something totally unrelated at the same time, most often work) and will serve as a form of public accountability to keep me on point.</del>  OK so slight update. I've decided that this won't be happening. I'm still going to read 26 books, but I'm no longer writing summaries for them. Unfortunately there are only so many hours in the day and I've got more important things to occupy them with.

I generally favor non-fiction books, but part of this challenge for me is to branch out and read some fiction. I hope to strike a good balance between the two but more than likely the list will be slanted towards non-fiction.

I decided to set this goal today, but I'm actually going to back date it to July 8 which means by January 8th, 2014 I need to have finished book #26.  Fortunately I'm already ahead of schedule ;)
