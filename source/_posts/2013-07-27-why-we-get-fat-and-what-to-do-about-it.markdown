Why We Get Fat was an eye opening book. The basic premise is that Foods rich in Carbohydrates cause a spike in insulin, a spike in insulin causes excess fat storage. Since excess fat storage causes so many illnesses such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease it should be eliminated. Therefore we should eliminate or minimize the amount of carbohydrates in our diet.

This makes sense. The part that was a little hard to swallow (hard to swallow since I've believed the opposite for so long) is that in order to make up for the loss of calories in the carbohydrates you are no longer eating, they should be replaced by proteins and fats, mostly from animal products.

In retrospect I think I bought into the 'No Animal Products ' bandwagon with far too little research of my own. The studies that the no animal products proponents often cite are often misleading, taken out of context or improperly performed.

For example they love to cite a study in which rats were given a diet of 20% protein or 5% protein. The rats who were give 20% protein had higher rates of cancer. What they always neglect to point out is that the 5% protein rats died significantly younger than the 20% rats, so of course they never had the chance to develop cancer. They died younger because they were literally starved of protein.

The book itself is easy to read and not overly dry like I was expecting. It definitely sparked a renewed interest in paying attention to what I eat, which is always a good thing.
