Myanmar. Oppressive Government. Remarkably friendly and welcoming people.

Two weeks before our scheduled arrival Myanmar was struck by 5 separate (minor, but still) bombings. I am so glad we did not cancel (although we almost did, numerous times).

Myanmar truly is largely unaffected by tourism and that is a fantastic thing. Take stunning natural beauty, throw in delicious food, millions of smiling faces genuinely happy to have you and you have one heck of a place to visit. Highly recommended.
