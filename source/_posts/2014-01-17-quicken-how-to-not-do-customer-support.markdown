My "Express Web Connect" to Wells Fargo with Quicken 2014 just stopped working one day. Quicken displayed a generic "Error CC-502" and simply suggested trying again in a few days. Three weeks pass with the same result. I decide to contact Quicken Support via Online Chat.

The final outcome.

Your options at this time are to download your Wells Fargo accounts through Web Connect or contact Wells Fargo to see if Direct Connect is available option.

Comforting. Very comforting.
