Writing on a daily basis (often referred to as "Keeping a Journal") has been a goal of mine for a while. I have always been mediocre at best and never really enjoyed it. More than likely its due to the fact that most of my writing comprised of late nights cramming in a paper that I should have started a week earlier on a topic I had little interest in (like Celtic Architecture).

Then I started writing just to write. To put my thoughts down on paper, not to persuade a boss, or get a good grade. I actually started to enjoy it and immediately noticing the [benefits](http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2013/05/20/benefits-of-writing/) [many](http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/) [people](http://lyndaryoung.blogspot.com/2012/09/6-benefits-of-writing-every-day.html) [have](http://www.myrkothum.com/the-benefits-of-writing-a-personal-journal/) [written](http://www.wordstrumpet.com/2010/01/the-benefits-of-writing-daily.html) [about](http://michaelhyatt.com/daily-journal.html) [before](http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2005/writing.html).

Now the first thing I do in the morning is spend 10-15 minutes just writing. Â I've found it puts me in the frame of mind to be productive. Try it for yourself. Instead of checking email, Facebook, or Twitter simply write your thoughts down. Generally I try to reflect on what I achieved yesterday (and what I could have done better), what I want to achieve today and anything else that happens to be on my mind at the time.

Naturally being a developer and unable to find the perfect way to write daily, I created my own tool that suits my needs perfectly. [DailyOJE is a distraction free way to write daily.](http://www.dailyoje.com)

I hope that someone else finds it as useful as I do.
