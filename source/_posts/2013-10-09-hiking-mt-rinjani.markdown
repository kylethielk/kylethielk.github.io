While in Lombok, Indonesia we made the very rash decision to hike to the top of Mt Rinjani. It was three days and two nights of stunning views and never ending lactic acid.

This was not only one of our most careless decisions but also our best. Exhilarating, exhausting, and absolutely worth every moment of agony. In those three days we walked over 25km with a total vertical distance of over 8km. We were wildly unprepared and definitely paid for it. Our recovery period consisted of two days of nothing but sleeping and feasting.

To make matters worse, each hiker has a porter who carries their tent, cooking supplies and all food and water. They carry this while wearing flip-flops and in easily half the time it takes us normal people. Demoralizing and motivating at the same time.
