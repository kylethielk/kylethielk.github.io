I have open sourced a tool I wrote to find potential followers on Twitter by allowing you to apply certain filtering criteria against a certain user's list of followers.

I recently undertook a pseudo-experiment to find the best way to grow my following on Twitter (later post to follow with results) and realized that I could easily automate a lot of what I was doing manually. This project is the result of that.

The tool is call [twitter-findtofollow](https://github.com/kylethielk/twitter-findtofollow) and is released under the MIT License. Click the link for more detailed instructions about how it works and how to use it.
