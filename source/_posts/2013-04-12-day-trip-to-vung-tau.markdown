Having only one day off a week, it can be challenging to find respite from hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh. Thankfully there is a beach that is only a little over an hour a way,  [Vung Tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vung_Tau). You can take a bus but that has the potential to take 3 hours depending on traffic. Or you can take a hydrofoil and get there in a claimed 75 minutes.

On the way there the ferry did indeed take only 75 minutes, and fortunately no sea sickness! Most of the journey takes part in a river system and there is only a small portion in the open sea.

Unfortunately we picked one of the rare overcast days here in Vietnam. When you only get one day off a week though, you take what you can get.

After a day of food and drinks on the beach, we stopped at [Christ of Vung Tau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_of_Vung_Tau) on our way off the island.

Unfortunately our trip back on the hydrofoil was closer to three hours. Its a good thing we hydrated before hand with some fresh coconuts.
