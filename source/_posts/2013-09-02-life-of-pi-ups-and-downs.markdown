Life of Pi is a quick read. Life of Pi took me 25 days to read, an average of 14.24 pages a day. It certainly put a damper on my attempt to read 26 books in 26 weeks (that and I'm currently reading the 800+ page "The Stand" by Stephen King) and I now have a lot of ground to make up. This was a particularly busy month (excuses, excuses) but the point is when I could actually make time the book was easy to get through and the total time to finish the book is not at all indicative of the time spent actually reading. There are very few characters and only one plot line to follow so very little cognitive power is required.

Life of PI starts off well. Pi walks us through his various encounters with Hinduism, Christianity and Islam and his attempts to be all three at once. His family dynamics and the various lessons he learns from them as well, which quickly and nicely set the stage for the meat of the book.

The majority of the book takes place on PI's lifeboat with his tiger shipmate, Richard Parker. At first the struggle to survive is enthralling, I didn't want to stop reading. Unfortuately it drags on, and on. I found myself losing interest fairly quickly. There were a few bright spots that brought me back in (the floating island), but mostly I was looking forward to the end.

The end comes and finishes off the story nicely. Its a story of hope and it makes you feel good despite the not so pleasant circumstances. So even though I lost interest the ending 'sort of' saves the book.

I watched the movie the day after completing the book (which is actually the first time I've ever read a book first). My recommendation is to watch it and skip the book. The movie is visually stunning and does an excellent job of condensing the book into a 2 hour film.
