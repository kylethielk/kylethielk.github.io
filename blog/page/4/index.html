			Tuesdays With Morrie, Only Slightly Disappointing.</a>

<p>Read: July 9 &ndash; 11, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tuesdays-Morrie-Young-Greatest-Lesson/dp/076790592X">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I somehow missed the Tuesdays with Morrie bandwagon.  I had no idea how popular of a book it was (in fact I had never heard of it) when I found it as a cheap photocopied version in a Saigon book store.</p>

<p>I managed to pick it up for 50,000VND or $2USD, drawn in by the synopsis on the back cover.</p>

<p>The book relates Morrie&rsquo;s thoughts about life and death to the reader as told to the author in weekly conversations held on a Tuesday. As each week progresses you experience the decay of Morrie&rsquo;s body, but not mind due to ALS.</p>

<p>A different topic is covered in each week&rsquo;s conversation such as Faith, Forgiveness, Marriage, Family, and Death. The author was 16 years prior a student of Morrie&rsquo;s and only recently re-connected when he heard of his old professor&rsquo;s impending death.  Sprinkled between the conversations are personal excerpts from Morrie and the author&rsquo;s life both together and separate.</p>

<p>The book is extremely easy to read. Each chapter is only a few pages long and it is written in a manner that is very easy to comprehend.  The book certainly inspires one to think of many important issues in life such as our society&rsquo;s over reliance on materialism, the lack of personal connections and the general lack of compassion (and therefore happiness since we believe the two to be interconnected).</p>

<p>Unfortunately the book only barely scratches the surface of each topic and leaves you wanting more, much more.  Its only in the final pages of the book that the author admits that the entire time both himself and Morrie were having these conversations with the intent of writing a book.  It certainly makes you question the authenticity of the whole thing.</p>

<p>In the end it was an enjoyable read and certainly leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside albeit slightly disappointed.</p>

			Not Too Manly to Keep a Journal.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Writing on a daily basis (often referred to as &ldquo;Keeping a Journal&rdquo;) has been a goal of mine for a while. I have always been mediocre at best and never really enjoyed it. More than likely its due to the fact that most of my writing comprised of late nights cramming in a paper that I should have started a week earlier on a topic I had little interest in (like Celtic Architecture).</p>

<p>Then I started writing just to write. To put my thoughts down on paper, not to persuade a boss, or get a good grade. I actually started to enjoy it and immediately noticing the <a href="http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2013/05/20/benefits-of-writing/">benefits</a> <a href="http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/">many</a> <a href="http://lyndaryoung.blogspot.com/2012/09/6-benefits-of-writing-every-day.html">people</a> <a href="http://www.myrkothum.com/the-benefits-of-writing-a-personal-journal/">have</a> <a href="http://www.wordstrumpet.com/2010/01/the-benefits-of-writing-daily.html">written</a> <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/daily-journal.html">about</a> <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2005/writing.html">before</a>.</p>

<p>Now the first thing I do in the morning is spend 10-15 minutes just writing.  I&rsquo;ve found it puts me in the frame of mind to be productive. Try it for yourself. Instead of checking email, Facebook, or Twitter simply write your thoughts down. Generally I try to reflect on what I achieved yesterday (and what I could have done better), what I want to achieve today and anything else that happens to be on my mind at the time.</p>

<p>Naturally being a developer and unable to find the perfect way to write daily, I created my own tool that suits my needs perfectly. <a href="http://www.dailyoje.com">DailyOJE is a distraction free way to write daily.</a></p>

<p>I hope that someone else finds it as useful as I do.</p>

			Waiting for Element With jQuery Mobile & WebDriverJS</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Selenium&rsquo;s webdriver API provides a convenient way to wait until an element is visible and ready, a common thing to do when testing AJAXy web apps.</p>

<p>In Java:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">By</span> <span class="n">byId</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">By</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;idOfElementWaitingFor&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">wait</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">until</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">ExpectedConditions</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">visibilityOfElementLocated</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">byId</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs">WebDriverJS </a> is a fantastic library of JavaScript bindings for Selenium&rsquo;s webserver that allows us to write our automated tests in javascript. It just makes sense (and feels correct) to write automated tests in javascript when your webapp is entirely javascript as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I encountered an issue almost immediately waiting for an element to visible and available when using jQuery Mobile, and surprisingly could find little help in the usual places (read: google).  This is how I solved it.</p>

<p>There are three tricks here.</p>

<ol>
<li>WebDriverJS is 100% non-blocking, we thus have to use the provided Promises construct, adding just a little bit of complexity.</li>
<li>jQuery Mobile, particularly in regards to paging, heavily utilizes hiding/showing elements so we have to ensure that the element exists AND that it is visible.</li>
<li>WebDriverJS&#8217; findElement() method will throw an error that is not suppressible. So we have to be careful using it when we fully expect an element not exist for a while.</li>
</ol>


<p>This method helps us solve all three. It first waits for the element to exist in the DOM, it then waits for the element to be visible and then it fulfills our promise. For example Selenium correctly complains when we try to click an element that exists, but is not visible.</p>

<p>For further clarification here is a sample usage:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">waitFor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;my-action-btn&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="c1">//...perform action on my-action-btn   </span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Just a note if the element never becomes available and visible, the error thrown by WebDriverJs&#8217; wait method will be propagated through.</p>

			Everything Is Overwhelming.</a>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/2e4959d75764">Cross Posted from Medium.com</a></p>

<p>My first reaction to anything new is almost guaranteed to be an overwhelming sense of, well being overwhelmed. This is not the most effective approach.</p>

<p>Duh. This realization does not have enough <em>gusto </em>to keep it from happening the next time. It will surely come with a sense of unease and unknowing, just as before.</p>

<p>I think this is normal. I think that by accepting it as normal it becomes easier to subdue. Easier to push out of the way and get what needs doing, done.</p>

<p>By breaking down your overwhelming task into underwhelming parts, the whole process becomes easy. If need be, break down the smaller parts into even more parts until no part by itself is too overwhelming. This is how I personally manage. The sooner I get to this point, the sooner I feel less anxious and more productive.</p>

<p>The next time you are feeling overwhelmed step back, accept it and carry on!</p>

		<p>My recently released Open Source Twitter tool <a href="https://github.com/kylethielk/twitter-findtofollow/">FindToFollow</a> has received some much needed updates and can now be used to automatically follow users that have been filtered. The follows occur successively with a randomly generated interval (with a set minimum and maximum) between each follow.</p>

<p>On the roadmap:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Filter currently followed users based on a set of criteria so that we can unfollow them automatically for example: &ldquo;Unfollow all users who have not followed me back in less than three days since I&rsquo;ve followed them&rdquo;. Similar to what ManageFlitter provides. We however will have more information as we know when users were followed and unfollowed, information ManageFlitter does not have.</p></li>
<li><p> Statistics about daily/weekly/monthly follower and friend counts.</p></li>

			Yahoo Export Contacts to CSV Broken for Facebook!</a>
	</h2>

		<p>There are <a href="http://readmeloud.com/how-to-export-facebook-contacts-in-csv-format/">many</a> <a href="http://webmaster-land.com/export-facebook-friends-to-google/">sources</a> <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/export-email-addresses-from-facebook/12970/">online</a> about how to export your facebook contacts but they all boil down to the same solution.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Import your facebook contacts into Yahoo.</p></li>
<li><p> Export your yahoo contacts to an open format.</p></li>
<li><p> Import the open format contacts into your system of choice.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This solution has worked for a while but is now broken. Yahoo no longer supports exporting contacts that were imported via facebook (personally, my bet is facebook made them). Fortunately Yahoo still supports printing these contacts to a simple HTML file which we can then parse ourselves. Even more fortunately someone already wrote an automated tool for us, <a href="http://campkludge.org/?q=yahoocontactexport">instructions and download link here</a>. It is only a matter of time before yahoo blocks this method as well so get to it.</p>

			Routine and Cu Chi Wildlife Rescue</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/cu-chi-wildlife-rescue-feat.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have now been in Ho Chi Minh for a little over two and a half months. Routine. It happens in even the most hectic and unknown places.  We&rsquo;ve started to find our regular places. Regular restaurants. Regular coffee. Regular gas stations.</p>

<p>I can now go more than 2 hours without having to pull over and look at Google Maps. I now drive the wrong way on one way streets without fear of dying in a fiery wreckage.  I eat ice and cold food without thinking twice (and only pay the price for it 1/10 of the time!).</p>

<p>Sometimes its good to break the routine. Thankfully we have met some stellar people here and they invited us to accompany them to <a href="http://www.wildlifeatrisk.org/new/activite/rescue_stations/508/tram-cuu-ho-dong-vat-hoang-da-cu-chi">Cu Chi Wildlife Rescue Station</a>. A butt numbing hour and forty five minute bike ride north west of the city. It is beautiful for the last half and you get to experience some very rural life.  The first half is hot, smoggy and full of traffic.</p>

			Twitter: FindToFollow</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have open sourced a tool I wrote to find potential followers on Twitter by allowing you to apply certain filtering criteria against a certain user&rsquo;s list of followers.</p>

<p>I recently undertook a pseudo-experiment to find the best way to grow my following on Twitter (later post to follow with results) and realized that I could easily automate a lot of what I was doing manually. This project is the result of that.</p>

<p>The tool is call <a href="https://github.com/kylethielk/twitter-findtofollow">twitter-findtofollow</a> and is released under the MIT License. Click the link for more detailed instructions about how it works and how to use it.</p>

			The &#8220;Ask Google&#8221; Syndrome.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a full time developer, I spend a large part of my life on my laptop and when I&rsquo;m doing anything else, my smartphone is only an arm&rsquo;s length away.  It has become so easy to develop what I call the &ldquo;Ask Google&rdquo; syndrome, the primary symptom being &ldquo;the unthinkingly reaction  to any unknown is to search google&rdquo;. Replace Google with your favorite tool of choice&hellip;Yelp, TripAdvisor, StackOverflow, Bing.</p>

<p>Consciously attempt to catch yourself in the act for a day. I was amazed at how often I do it, most of the time without giving the question or problem any independent thought.  I&rsquo;ve been guilty of this behavior for so long its second nature and that scares me.</p>

<p>Asking Google is equivalent to cramming in school.  You will more than likely get the correct answer but long term retention and a deep understanding of the material is highly unlikely. The syndrome is highly compounding since a deep understanding of the solution (and more than likely the problem) is not achieved.  The next time a similar issue is encountered you will be forced to google the same thing again. There is so much to be gained from working through a problem. Like your teachers always said, &ldquo;Show your work&rdquo;!</p>

			Four Day Trip to Mui Ne</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">

<strong>
</strong>Ho Chi Minh is exhilarating.  It is fast paced.  It is vibrant. It can start to wear on you. After seeing your third person defecating in broad daylight on the sidewalk in one week and not even thinking twice about it? It might be time to take a break.</p>

<p>With four days available to us o/media/images/ur options were basically Da Lat, Phu Quoc Island and Mui Ne. Phu Quoc Island requires almost an entire day of travel each way, so even though it was our top choice, we chose to save it for another time. Da Lat is currently cold enough to require a jacket&hellip;not gonna happen. Mui Ne it was!</p>

<p>One arduous six hour bus drive there (which paled in comparison to our bus trip home, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1009804-i12979-k5272484-Tam_Hanh_Bus_Company-Mui_Ne_Phan_Thiet_Binh_Thuan_Province.html">never ever use Tam Hanh Bus Company</a>!). Bus Tickets were $12/person each way. So a total of $48 for the both of us round-trip.  We managed to book a phenomenal boutique hotel while we were there (<a href="http://shadesmuine.com/home/">Shades Mui Ne</a>). Excellent choice.</p>

<p>![Mui Ne Shades Resort Beach View at Sunset.](/media/images/mui-ne-shades-resort-sunset.jpg &ldquo;Mui Ne Shades Resort Beach View at Sunset.</p>

<p>Three days of ultra relaxing ,coffee sipping, book reading, happy hour indulging times by the pool and beach. During the day Mui Ne is nothing but a sleepy beach town, its really too hot to do much of anything else. By night..well its basically the same but with far more food options.  There is a long (proably &frac12; km) of seafood stalls serving all of the fresh (sea)food you could ever want. Snake, Eel, Shark, Fish, Clams, Frog, Lizard you name it.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/alligator-for-dinner.jpg" title="Alligator anyone?" alt="Alligator in Mui Ne" /></p>

<p>Just like Ho Chi Minh, the only way to travel is by Motorbike. For $8/day you have freedom. Unlike Ho Chi Minh, Mui Ne&rsquo;s traffic is essentially non-existent.</p>

<p>Mui Ne is most well known for their white and red sand dunes. The red sand dunes are a quick 15 minute bike ride outside of town. The white sand dunes are a 45-60 minute ride outside of town.  On our first day with the motorbike we drove by the red sand dunes. Litter, hawkers, tourists everywhere!  The next morning we woke at 4:30AM and were on the road by 4:45AM with the goal of making it to the white sand dunes by sunrise. After making one incorrect turn and driving only a little too fast for comfort we barely made it at 5:30.  It turned out to be totally worth it:</p>

<p>The motorbike drive home was fairly uneventful but we were able to see quite a few locals out and about.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/oxen-drawn-carriage.jpg" title="Might as well be on the Oregon trial." alt="Might as well be on the Oregon trial." /></p>

<p>Of course any place in Vietnam wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without adorable little kids everywhere.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/sneaky-shot-of-kid.jpg" title="Camera shy kid. We had to sneakily take his photo." alt="Camera shy kid. We had to sneakily take his photo." /></p>

<p>Unfortunately our bus ride home put quite a damper on a trip that was otherwise fantastic. The Air Conditioner broke down 30 minutes into the ride.  Our only source of air being the bus door  at the front of the bus with us sitting in the back. The breeze might not have made it back, but the smells certainly did! Also I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is the text all bus agencies put out with their wanted ads:</p>

<blockquote>Wanted. The most unapologetic, rude and dislikeable people please apply. Complete disdain for tourists a bonus. Complete disdain for locals even more of a plus. Don&#8217;t bother applying if you care, about anything.</blockquote>


<p>But it will all be OK because of this guy:</p>
