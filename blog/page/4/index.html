			Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It</a>

<p>Read: July 8 &ndash; 14, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307474259">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Why We Get Fat was an eye opening book. The basic premise is that Foods rich in Carbohydrates cause a spike in insulin, a spike in insulin causes excess fat storage. Since excess fat storage causes so many illnesses such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease it should be eliminated. Therefore we should eliminate or minimize the amount of carbohydrates in our diet.</p>

<p>This makes sense. The part that was a little hard to swallow (hard to swallow since I&rsquo;ve believed the opposite for so long) is that in order to make up for the loss of calories in the carbohydrates you are no longer eating, they should be replaced by proteins and fats, mostly from animal products.</p>

<p>In retrospect I think I bought into the &lsquo;No Animal Products &rsquo; bandwagon with far too little research of my own. The studies that the no animal products proponents often cite are often misleading, taken out of context or improperly performed.</p>

<p>For example they love to cite a study in which rats were given a diet of 20% protein or 5% protein. The rats who were give 20% protein had higher rates of cancer. What they always neglect to point out is that the 5% protein rats died significantly younger than the 20% rats, so of course they never had the chance to develop cancer. They died younger because they were literally starved of protein.</p>

<p>The book itself is easy to read and not overly dry like I was expecting. It definitely sparked a renewed interest in paying attention to what I eat, which is always a good thing.</p>

			26 Books in 26 Weeks</a>

<p>I hate reading. Rather, I <em>hated</em> reading.</p>

<p>Something, somewhere has a sparked a passion for reading and now I actually want to do it. I even read a fiction&hellip;and liked it!</p>

<p>One of the many benefits of living and travelling internationally is an abundance of downtime. I plan on filing this downtime with books, lots and lots of books. The timing works out that I have right around 6 months  before resuming &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life (not to say I don&rsquo;t plan on continuing to read voraciously, or even that travelling isn&rsquo;t a normal life).</p>

<p>Setting a goal is a good way to guarantee success and thus here it is: <strong>26 Books in 26 Weeks</strong>. That might not sound like a lot, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I haven&rsquo;t read that many books in my entire life (to completion).</p>

<p><del>Each book read will be accompanied by its own post.  This will force me to actually &lsquo;read&rsquo; each book (as opposed to my bad habit of skimming and thinking of something totally unrelated at the same time, most often work) and will serve as a form of public accountability to keep me on point.</del>  OK so slight update. I&rsquo;ve decided that this won&rsquo;t be happening. I&rsquo;m still going to read 26 books, but I&rsquo;m no longer writing summaries for them. Unfortunately there are only so many hours in the day and I&rsquo;ve got more important things to occupy them with.</p>

<p>I generally favor non-fiction books, but part of this challenge for me is to branch out and read some fiction. I hope to strike a good balance between the two but more than likely the list will be slanted towards non-fiction.</p>

<p>I decided to set this goal today, but I&rsquo;m actually going to back date it to July 8 which means by January 8th, 2014 I need to have finished book #26.  Fortunately I&rsquo;m already ahead of schedule ;)</p>

			Tuesdays With Morrie, Only Slightly Disappointing.</a>
	</h2>

		<p><img src="/media/images/tuesdays-with-morrie-thumb.jpg" title="Tuesdays With Morrie" alt="Tuesdays With Morrie" /></p>

<p>Read: July 9 &ndash; 11, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tuesdays-Morrie-Young-Greatest-Lesson/dp/076790592X">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I somehow missed the Tuesdays with Morrie bandwagon.  I had no idea how popular of a book it was (in fact I had never heard of it) when I found it as a cheap photocopied version in a Saigon book store.</p>

<p>I managed to pick it up for 50,000VND or $2USD, drawn in by the synopsis on the back cover.</p>

<p>The book relates Morrie&rsquo;s thoughts about life and death to the reader as told to the author in weekly conversations held on a Tuesday. As each week progresses you experience the decay of Morrie&rsquo;s body, but not mind due to ALS.</p>

<p>A different topic is covered in each week&rsquo;s conversation such as Faith, Forgiveness, Marriage, Family, and Death. The author was 16 years prior a student of Morrie&rsquo;s and only recently re-connected when he heard of his old professor&rsquo;s impending death.  Sprinkled between the conversations are personal excerpts from Morrie and the author&rsquo;s life both together and separate.</p>

<p>The book is extremely easy to read. Each chapter is only a few pages long and it is written in a manner that is very easy to comprehend.  The book certainly inspires one to think of many important issues in life such as our society&rsquo;s over reliance on materialism, the lack of personal connections and the general lack of compassion (and therefore happiness since we believe the two to be interconnected).</p>

<p>Unfortunately the book only barely scratches the surface of each topic and leaves you wanting more, much more.  Its only in the final pages of the book that the author admits that the entire time both himself and Morrie were having these conversations with the intent of writing a book.  It certainly makes you question the authenticity of the whole thing.</p>

<p>In the end it was an enjoyable read and certainly leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside albeit slightly disappointed.</p>

			Not Too Manly to Keep a Journal.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Writing on a daily basis (often referred to as &ldquo;Keeping a Journal&rdquo;) has been a goal of mine for a while. I have always been mediocre at best and never really enjoyed it. More than likely its due to the fact that most of my writing comprised of late nights cramming in a paper that I should have started a week earlier on a topic I had little interest in (like Celtic Architecture).</p>

<p>Then I started writing just to write. To put my thoughts down on paper, not to persuade a boss, or get a good grade. I actually started to enjoy it and immediately noticing the <a href="http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2013/05/20/benefits-of-writing/">benefits</a> <a href="http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/">many</a> <a href="http://lyndaryoung.blogspot.com/2012/09/6-benefits-of-writing-every-day.html">people</a> <a href="http://www.myrkothum.com/the-benefits-of-writing-a-personal-journal/">have</a> <a href="http://www.wordstrumpet.com/2010/01/the-benefits-of-writing-daily.html">written</a> <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/daily-journal.html">about</a> <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2005/writing.html">before</a>.</p>

<p>Now the first thing I do in the morning is spend 10-15 minutes just writing.  I&rsquo;ve found it puts me in the frame of mind to be productive. Try it for yourself. Instead of checking email, Facebook, or Twitter simply write your thoughts down. Generally I try to reflect on what I achieved yesterday (and what I could have done better), what I want to achieve today and anything else that happens to be on my mind at the time.</p>

<p>Naturally being a developer and unable to find the perfect way to write daily, I created my own tool that suits my needs perfectly. <a href="http://www.dailyoje.com">DailyOJE is a distraction free way to write daily.</a></p>

<p>I hope that someone else finds it as useful as I do.</p>

			Waiting for Element With jQuery Mobile & WebDriverJS</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Selenium&rsquo;s webdriver API provides a convenient way to wait until an element is visible and ready, a common thing to do when testing AJAXy web apps.</p>

<p>In Java:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">By</span> <span class="n">byId</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">By</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;idOfElementWaitingFor&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs">WebDriverJS </a> is a fantastic library of JavaScript bindings for Selenium&rsquo;s webserver that allows us to write our automated tests in javascript. It just makes sense (and feels correct) to write automated tests in javascript when your webapp is entirely javascript as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I encountered an issue almost immediately waiting for an element to visible and available when using jQuery Mobile, and surprisingly could find little help in the usual places (read: google).  This is how I solved it.</p>

<li>WebDriverJS is 100% non-blocking, we thus have to use the provided Promises construct, adding just a little bit of complexity.</li>
<li>jQuery Mobile, particularly in regards to paging, heavily utilizes hiding/showing elements so we have to ensure that the element exists AND that it is visible.</li>
<li>WebDriverJS&#8217; findElement() method will throw an error that is not suppressible. So we have to be careful using it when we fully expect an element not exist for a while.</li>
</ol>


<p>This method helps us solve all three. It first waits for the element to exist in the DOM, it then waits for the element to be visible and then it fulfills our promise. For example Selenium correctly complains when we try to click an element that exists, but is not visible.</p>

<p>For further clarification here is a sample usage:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">waitFor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;my-action-btn&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="c1">//...perform action on my-action-btn   </span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Just a note if the element never becomes available and visible, the error thrown by WebDriverJs&#8217; wait method will be propagated through.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/2e4959d75764">Cross Posted from Medium.com</a></p>

<p>My first reaction to anything new is almost guaranteed to be an overwhelming sense of, well being overwhelmed. This is not the most effective approach.</p>

<p>Duh. This realization does not have enough <em>gusto </em>to keep it from happening the next time. It will surely come with a sense of unease and unknowing, just as before.</p>

<p>I think this is normal. I think that by accepting it as normal it becomes easier to subdue. Easier to push out of the way and get what needs doing, done.</p>

<p>By breaking down your overwhelming task into underwhelming parts, the whole process becomes easy. If need be, break down the smaller parts into even more parts until no part by itself is too overwhelming. This is how I personally manage. The sooner I get to this point, the sooner I feel less anxious and more productive.</p>

<p>The next time you are feeling overwhelmed step back, accept it and carry on!</p>

			Twitter-FindToFollow Update</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My recently released Open Source Twitter tool <a href="https://github.com/kylethielk/twitter-findtofollow/">FindToFollow</a> has received some much needed updates and can now be used to automatically follow users that have been filtered. The follows occur successively with a randomly generated interval (with a set minimum and maximum) between each follow.</p>

<p>On the roadmap:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Filter currently followed users based on a set of criteria so that we can unfollow them automatically for example: &ldquo;Unfollow all users who have not followed me back in less than three days since I&rsquo;ve followed them&rdquo;. Similar to what ManageFlitter provides. We however will have more information as we know when users were followed and unfollowed, information ManageFlitter does not have.</p></li>
<li><p> Statistics about daily/weekly/monthly follower and friend counts.</p></li>
</ol>

			Yahoo Export Contacts to CSV Broken for Facebook!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are <a href="http://readmeloud.com/how-to-export-facebook-contacts-in-csv-format/">many</a> <a href="http://webmaster-land.com/export-facebook-friends-to-google/">sources</a> <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/export-email-addresses-from-facebook/12970/">online</a> about how to export your facebook contacts but they all boil down to the same solution.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Import your facebook contacts into Yahoo.</p></li>
<li><p> Export your yahoo contacts to an open format.</p></li>
<li><p> Import the open format contacts into your system of choice.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This solution has worked for a while but is now broken. Yahoo no longer supports exporting contacts that were imported via facebook (personally, my bet is facebook made them). Fortunately Yahoo still supports printing these contacts to a simple HTML file which we can then parse ourselves. Even more fortunately someone already wrote an automated tool for us, <a href="http://campkludge.org/?q=yahoocontactexport">instructions and download link here</a>. It is only a matter of time before yahoo blocks this method as well so get to it.</p>

			Routine and Cu Chi Wildlife Rescue</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/cu-chi-wildlife-rescue-feat.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have now been in Ho Chi Minh for a little over two and a half months. Routine. It happens in even the most hectic and unknown places.  We&rsquo;ve started to find our regular places. Regular restaurants. Regular coffee. Regular gas stations.</p>

<p>I can now go more than 2 hours without having to pull over and look at Google Maps. I now drive the wrong way on one way streets without fear of dying in a fiery wreckage.  I eat ice and cold food without thinking twice (and only pay the price for it 1/10 of the time!).</p>

<p>Sometimes its good to break the routine. Thankfully we have met some stellar people here and they invited us to accompany them to <a href="http://www.wildlifeatrisk.org/new/activite/rescue_stations/508/tram-cuu-ho-dong-vat-hoang-da-cu-chi">Cu Chi Wildlife Rescue Station</a>. A butt numbing hour and forty five minute bike ride north west of the city. It is beautiful for the last half and you get to experience some very rural life.  The first half is hot, smoggy and full of traffic.</p>

			Twitter: FindToFollow</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have open sourced a tool I wrote to find potential followers on Twitter by allowing you to apply certain filtering criteria against a certain user&rsquo;s list of followers.</p>

<p>I recently undertook a pseudo-experiment to find the best way to grow my following on Twitter (later post to follow with results) and realized that I could easily automate a lot of what I was doing manually. This project is the result of that.</p>

<p>The tool is call <a href="https://github.com/kylethielk/twitter-findtofollow">twitter-findtofollow</a> and is released under the MIT License. Click the link for more detailed instructions about how it works and how to use it.</p>
