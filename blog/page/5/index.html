			The &#8220;Ask Google&#8221; Syndrome.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a full time developer, I spend a large part of my life on my laptop and when I&rsquo;m doing anything else, my smartphone is only an arm&rsquo;s length away.  It has become so easy to develop what I call the &ldquo;Ask Google&rdquo; syndrome, the primary symptom being &ldquo;the unthinkingly reaction  to any unknown is to search google&rdquo;. Replace Google with your favorite tool of choice&hellip;Yelp, TripAdvisor, StackOverflow, Bing.</p>

<p>Consciously attempt to catch yourself in the act for a day. I was amazed at how often I do it, most of the time without giving the question or problem any independent thought.  I&rsquo;ve been guilty of this behavior for so long its second nature and that scares me.</p>

<p>Asking Google is equivalent to cramming in school.  You will more than likely get the correct answer but long term retention and a deep understanding of the material is highly unlikely. The syndrome is highly compounding since a deep understanding of the solution (and more than likely the problem) is not achieved.  The next time a similar issue is encountered you will be forced to google the same thing again. There is so much to be gained from working through a problem. Like your teachers always said, &ldquo;Show your work&rdquo;!</p>

			Four Day Trip to Mui Ne</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/mui-ne-featured.jpg" title="Mui Ne Header" alt="" />
<strong>
</strong>Ho Chi Minh is exhilarating.  It is fast paced.  It is vibrant. It can start to wear on you. After seeing your third person defecating in broad daylight on the sidewalk in one week and not even thinking twice about it? It might be time to take a break.</p>

<p>With four days available to us o/media/images/ur options were basically Da Lat, Phu Quoc Island and Mui Ne. Phu Quoc Island requires almost an entire day of travel each way, so even though it was our top choice, we chose to save it for another time. Da Lat is currently cold enough to require a jacket&hellip;not gonna happen. Mui Ne it was!</p>

<p>One arduous six hour bus drive there (which paled in comparison to our bus trip home, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1009804-i12979-k5272484-Tam_Hanh_Bus_Company-Mui_Ne_Phan_Thiet_Binh_Thuan_Province.html">never ever use Tam Hanh Bus Company</a>!). Bus Tickets were $12/person each way. So a total of $48 for the both of us round-trip.  We managed to book a phenomenal boutique hotel while we were there (<a href="http://shadesmuine.com/home/">Shades Mui Ne</a>). Excellent choice.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/mui-ne-shades-resort.jpg" title="Mui Ne Shades Resort." alt="Mui Ne Shades Resort." /></p>

<p>![Mui Ne Shades Resort Beach View at Sunset.](/media/images/mui-ne-shades-resort-sunset.jpg &ldquo;Mui Ne Shades Resort Beach View at Sunset.</p>

<p>Three days of ultra relaxing ,coffee sipping, book reading, happy hour indulging times by the pool and beach. During the day Mui Ne is nothing but a sleepy beach town, its really too hot to do much of anything else. By night..well its basically the same but with far more food options.  There is a long (proably &frac12; km) of seafood stalls serving all of the fresh (sea)food you could ever want. Snake, Eel, Shark, Fish, Clams, Frog, Lizard you name it.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/alligator-for-dinner.jpg" title="Alligator anyone?" alt="Alligator in Mui Ne" /></p>

<p>Just like Ho Chi Minh, the only way to travel is by Motorbike. For $8/day you have freedom. Unlike Ho Chi Minh, Mui Ne&rsquo;s traffic is essentially non-existent.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/mui-ne-by-motorbike.jpg" title="Mui Ne by Motorbike" alt="Mui Ne by Motorbike" /></p>

<p>Mui Ne is most well known for their white and red sand dunes. The red sand dunes are a quick 15 minute bike ride outside of town. The white sand dunes are a 45-60 minute ride outside of town.  On our first day with the motorbike we drove by the red sand dunes. Litter, hawkers, tourists everywhere!  The next morning we woke at 4:30AM and were on the road by 4:45AM with the goal of making it to the white sand dunes by sunrise. After making one incorrect turn and driving only a little too fast for comfort we barely made it at 5:30.  It turned out to be totally worth it:</p>

<p>The motorbike drive home was fairly uneventful but we were able to see quite a few locals out and about.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/oxen-drawn-carriage.jpg" title="Might as well be on the Oregon trial." alt="Might as well be on the Oregon trial." /></p>

<p>Of course any place in Vietnam wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without adorable little kids everywhere.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/sneaky-shot-of-kid.jpg" title="Camera shy kid. We had to sneakily take his photo." alt="Camera shy kid. We had to sneakily take his photo." /></p>

<p>Unfortunately our bus ride home put quite a damper on a trip that was otherwise fantastic. The Air Conditioner broke down 30 minutes into the ride.  Our only source of air being the bus door  at the front of the bus with us sitting in the back. The breeze might not have made it back, but the smells certainly did! Also I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is the text all bus agencies put out with their wanted ads:</p>

<blockquote>Wanted. The most unapologetic, rude and dislikeable people please apply. Complete disdain for tourists a bonus. Complete disdain for locals even more of a plus. Don&#8217;t bother applying if you care, about anything.</blockquote>


<p>But it will all be OK because of this guy:</p>

			Day Trip to Vung Tau</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/vung-tau-featured.jpg" title="Vung Tau Header" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having only one day off a week, it can be challenging to find respite from hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh. Thankfully there is a beach that is only a little over an hour a way,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vung_Tau">Vung Tau</a>. You can take a bus but that has the potential to take 3 hours depending on traffic. Or you can take a hydrofoil and get there in a claimed 75 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/hydrofoil.jpg" title="Our hydrofoil to Vung Tau." alt="Our hydrofoil to Vung Tau." /></p>

<p>On the way there the ferry did indeed take only 75 minutes, and fortunately no sea sickness! Most of the journey takes part in a river system and there is only a small portion in the open sea.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/hydrofoil-route.jpg" title="Hydrofoil route from Ho Chi Minh to Vung Tau." alt="Hydrofoil route from Ho Chi Minh to Vung Tau." /></p>

<p>Unfortunately we picked one of the rare overcast days here in Vietnam. When you only get one day off a week though, you take what you can get.</p>

			Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 - Update Your Drivers</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I wanted to blame my router. I did blame my router. My past experiences have proven consumer grade routers to be one step above printers in terms of quality and reliability.  If my connection was flaky simply pull the plug on the router, wait 30 seconds and plugin it back in. Voila.</p>

<p>This time was different.  Pulling the plug on the router was a risky venture. It is shared between four other apartments. When I did manage to sneak in a quick reset, the results were inconsistent. I&rsquo;d regain connectivity for an hour one time, 5 minutes the next.</p>

<p>75% of the time I&rsquo;d still be connected to my router&rsquo;s internal network, but could not reach the internet. Other devices could connected to the same device had no problem accessing the internet. The other 25% of the time my wireless adapter became stuck in an infinite loop of attempting to connect the the network and failing.</p>

<p>The moral of this story? Update your freaking drivers, then waste the 10 hours fiddling with settings trying to fish out any incompatibilities between your router and network adapter if things still don&rsquo;t work.  Turns out my network adapter, the Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 has <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/network-internet-wireless/f/3324/t/19497638.aspx">quite </a>a <a href="http://communities.intel.com/thread/31090">few </a> <a href="http://communities.intel.com/thread/32788">issues</a> with its older drivers. <a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/wireless/can-6235">Here is the direct link to download the latest drivers</a>.</p>

<p>Updating the drivers did the trick for me, thus saving my laptop from a suicide leap out of the third floor window.</p>

<p>Motorbikes. The thrill of weaving in and out of traffic, as if there are no consequences because really&hellip;there are none. Riding on the back of of a Xe Ôm for $1, half way across town. It lends a whole new level of appreciation to the city.</p>

<p>Traffic. There is a ton of it, but it constantly moves. No stand still traffic like home. I&rsquo;d estimate 49 for every 50 vehicles is a motorbike. Traffic in a sea of motorbikes is better than traffic in a sea of cars.</p>

			Vietnam: English Free</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/featured-vietnam.jpg" alt="&quot;Street stand in Ho Chi Minh&quot;" /></p>

<p>Christina and I have been in Vietnam (specifically Ho Chi Minh) for just two days and already we have fallen in love. The city is so vibrant, the people so nice and the food is, as expected, delicious.</p>

<p>No amount of reading can really prepare you for Vietnam. It really is something that must be experienced and soaked in. The city runs at a dizzying pace and yet the people all seem so calm. The traffic here is insane but it has a rhythm that seems to make sense. Simply crossing the street is an extremely entertaining exercise each and everytime. 95% of the traffic consists of mopeds and the concept of lanes is non-existent.</p>

<p>Christina and I are staying very far off the beaten path, well the beaten tourist path. We have yet to see another &lsquo;foreigner&rsquo; and almost nobody speaks english. Although intimidating at first, we have quickly adjusted. Body language, pointing and basic vietnam phrases (very poorly spoken on our part) are generally enough to get by. I figured that by now most Vietnamese would be accustom to foreign visitors and I&rsquo;m sure that in the touristy parts of town they are. District 10 (our part of town) seems to be mostly unvisited by foreigners. Ventures outside of the hotel are met with interested stares and quizzical smiles.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/pho-restaurant.jpg" title="Street Food" alt="Street Food Saigon." /></p>

<p>Some of the most important things we have learned:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Wait to change USD to VND until you are in Vietnam. Rate in San Francisco airport: $1 USD &ndash;> 18,700 VND. Rate in Ho Chi Minh airport (and around city): $1 USD &ndash;> 20,900 VND. We arrived at 10:45PM and the Currency Exchange window was still open.</p></li>
<li><p> Prices are rarely set or displayed. Everything is a barter. If a vendor holds up five fingers this generally means a price of 50,000 VND (roughly $2.50). Bargaining is hard in non-tourist parts of town because most vendors speak no english. Christina and I have started carrying around a notebook so we can write down prices, or we just show the amount we want to pay with actual bills. We have found that most street vendors selling prepared food like Pho have reasonable prices, everyone else will try to get you to pay more than fair price.</p></li>
<li><p> Taxi scams are everywhere at the airport. We read extensively about how to not be ripped off, and were still taken advantage of. Agree on a price before, insist on the meter being used or buy a pre-paid rate card at the airport. The cab driver attempted to charge us 600,000 VND, when the fair price is roughly 150,000 VND. We eventually got it down to 250,000 VND, still more than we should have paid.</p></li>
<li><p> Everything but electronics are cheap. Average plate of Pho from street vendor is $1. Sanitation is questionable at most street vendors, so buyer beware. Nicer restaurants can be had for $2 &ndash; $3 per bowl.</p></li>
<li><p> Vietnamese coffee is amazing. Ca Phe or Ca Phe Da(Iced) or Ca Phe Da Sua (Iced with Milk) is absolutely delicious. Unbelievably strong, but ridiculously delicious. Most can be had for $0.75.</p></li>
<li><p> Riding motorbikes is exhilirating. Christina and I have only been on the back of one so far, but I can&rsquo;t wait to drive one myself.</p></li>
<li><p> So far I have felt extremely safe. Common sense (i.e don&rsquo;t flash large amounts of cash, electronics, zippered pockets, well secured backpacks) goes a long way.</p></li>
<li><p> Cash is king, most places you will want to be frequenting require cash.</p></li>
<li><p> Cellphone service is cheap. If you plan on staying for an extended period of time getting a local phone is an excellent idea. Pay by the minute is roughly $0.05/min and text messages are about $0.01/min.</p></li>
<li><p>. Tra Da (Iced Tea, generally made with Jasmine leaves) is like water in the USA. Given at basically every restaurant for free just like water. Unlike most Vietnamese drinks, it is not sweetened though.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Vietnam is extremely great value for the money. Our hotel is one of the nice hotels, brand new, flat screen TV, free WIFI, all the amenities of a hotel back home and only costs $26/night.</p>

			Wordpress Plugin Development: Using Media Library</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When porting <a href="https://github.com/kylethielk/jquery-refolio"> jquery-refolio</a> over to wordpress one of the things I wanted to do was tie into wordpress&#8217; Media Library. This makes it extremely easy to re-use images already in wordpress and it would mean I didn&rsquo;t have to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-unless-you-plan-on-learning-more-about-wheels.html">re-invent the wheel</a>. Shockingly enough I couldn&rsquo;t find it documented anywhere in Wordpress&#8217; officials documentation and even a few quick googles came up empty.</p>

<p>I eventually stumbled upon the answer and I was suprised at how easy it was. Hopefully this will help someone in the future trying to do the same thing.</p>

<p>To launch the media manager from javascript:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">//launch media library popup</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="nx">tb_show</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Choose Portfolio Image&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;media-upload.php?type=image&amp;TB_iframe=true&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You must then register a callback as such (the name is important and must be registered in the global namespace):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="cm">/**</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cm">* @param html Will be passed the html for the selected image.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cm">*/</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send_to_editor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">html</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">imageUrl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;img&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">html</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;src&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">//Hide media library popup.</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="nx">tb_remove</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The callback will be invoked when the user has selected an image to insert. Here is a sample HTML snippet passed back to the callback function:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/?attachment_id=971&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;attachment wp-att-971&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/big-image2.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;484&quot;</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;317&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-971&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Good luck!</p>
