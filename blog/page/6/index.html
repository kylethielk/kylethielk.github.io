			The Importance of Goals</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The times that I find myself most likely to be distracted (read: not to doing what really matters) are directly related to the times when I have not clearly defined my goals.</p>

<p>Goals give me a sense of purpose and clearly set out what I need to achieve. Not having goals makes it easier to reason with myself that opening a new tab for Reddit for 5 minutes won&rsquo;t matter. The problem is those 5 minutes turn into 45 minutes. 45 minutes of pure focused work is a lot to waste.</p>

<p>I try to start each day going over my goals for the day. I&rsquo;ve found that just looking at and thinking about my goals for five minutes each day before starting any work (that includes checking your emails in bed still half asleep) is a great way to come out of the gate strong. It doesn&rsquo;t leave any room for CNN, Hacker News or any other distractions you&rsquo;ve convinced yourself are actually worthwhile.</p>

<p>I generally have three sets of goals (which I maintain with <a href="http://www.trello.com">trello</a>, a list for each set and a board with these three lists for each product I&rsquo;m working on).</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Short Term Goals &ndash; Generally 1-2 day and are probably more attune to tasks.</p></li>
<li><p> Medium Term Goals &ndash; Generally 2 weeks in the future</p></li>
<li><p> Long Term Goals &ndash; Anything longer than 2 weeks.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The categories are intentionally vague. The real benefit comes from simply writing down your goals. Personally I&rsquo;ve found that placing strict restrictions on your goals almost never works. I know whats really important and what needs attention first, I don&rsquo;t need to write it down. I just need to write down the actual goals.</p>

<p>Setting goals is of utmost importance when you are working in a somewhat independent environment, whether that be as a freelancer or consultant or entrepreneur. In a normal 9-5 job your goals are generally set by those paid more than you.  In that case you and your bosses know exactly what you need to achieve and you are accountable to them. It is important to set goals and it is important to be held accountable to them. Even if that means telling your spouse/girlfriend/boyfriend/sister. Make yourself accountable to someone or something. For some people being held accountable to themselves is enough.</p>

<p>(Note the screenshot is an actual trello board I am using for a project I&rsquo;m working on)</p>

			Centering Article Element in Internet Explorer With Margin:auto</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Its amazing how many quirks internet explorer has when it comes to proper handlingof css. Another one to add to the list.</p>

<p>A common trick to center an element on the screen regardless of the user&rsquo;s resolution is to:</p>

<ol>
<li> Set the element&rsquo;s width</li>
<li> Define margin-left and margin-right to auto i.e</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">0</span> <span class="nt">auto</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">15px</span> <span class="nt">auto</span> <span class="nt">5px</span> <span class="nt">auto</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Internet Explorer for the most part handles this correctly. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/662341/using-margin-0-auto-in-internet-explorer-8">See when it doesn&rsquo;t work properly</a>)</p>

<p>Unfortunately this trick does not work on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/article.html">HTML5 article element</a> in IE9 (not tested on other versions of Internet Explorer although I imagine they behave similar).</p>

<p>The workaround is to wrap your article element in a DIV or other equivalent block element.</p>

			Switching to the Lap</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve fought it. I&rsquo;ve been winning but I finally lost.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve thus far resisted going for the lap. It doesn&rsquo;t have what I need and even if it did, I couldn&rsquo;t afford the costs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a media buff. I like collecting stuff. Music, movies, pictures. I&rsquo;m also really into figuring out solutions to problems as a developer. I need power.</p>

<p>My only option was a desktop. For the space, for the power, for the cost and the practicality.</p>

<p>For awhile it just wasn&rsquo;t possible to get the power and storage I wanted with a laptop, no matter how much money you threw at the problem. Things progressed and it was possible, for a very large cost both financially and in terms sacrifices required. Want power and a lot of storage? Get your wallet out and don&rsquo;t forget your power supply. Won&rsquo;t be getting very far with an hour of battery life and a twelve pound monstrosity in you bag.  Oh and don&rsquo;t keep it your lap, that sucker will be reaching 120° F+</p>

<p>I was an early adopter when the first generation netbooks came out. I picked up an Asus Netbook for around $500. The promise of low power and portable computer power suckered me in and spit me right out. Severely under powered, cheap plastic design and only marginally decent battery times. It definitely put a bitter taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>Its never really been a problem for me. I enjoyed building my own desktops and I enjoyed saving money. I&rsquo;ve never really traveled long enough to need one.</p>

<p>Shortly however travelling will be a way of life and a laptop a necessity. This time I had no choice and finally broke down. I am now a laptop owner&hellip;.a happy one!</p>

<p>There are still sacrifices that have to be made. This time around though, they are significantly smaller and less drastic. I have been using my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-NP900X3C-A05US-13-3-Inch-Premium-Ultrabook/dp/B0098O6GD4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355699023&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=samsung+series+9">Samsung Series 9</a> for over a month and could not be happier. Powerful, sleek, and uses 1/3 as much power as my desktop at idle. Its brilliant.  The sacrifice I had to make? 128GB SSD that is blazing fast, but a little on the small size.  The speed makes up for the lack of space though.</p>

<p>Google Drive gives me access to my media in the cloud and Spotify fulfills my 10 hour a day music fix. I haven&rsquo;t even turned my desktop on for a month.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say the desktop is dead&hellip;its just limping on its last leg.</p>

			AAdvantage Requires Marketing Subscription to Maintain Benefits.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/aa-dining-scam-1.jpg" title="Screenshot of signup requirement." alt="Screenshot of signup requirement." /></p>

<p>In what has become a monthly task, I comb my email and unsubscribe from newsletters that I habitually archive/delete without even opening the darn thing. These marketing newsletters tend to accumulate over the years and occasionally they need to be culled for sanity&rsquo;s sake. One of the newsletters on the chopping block this time around was <a href="https://www.aa.com/AAdvantage">AAdvantage</a> (American Airline&rsquo;s Frequent Flier Program).</p>

<p>I was unpleasantly surprised to find that by unsubscribing to their marketing emails, I was also unsubscribing from my premium benefits. <strong>That&rsquo;s right, in order to unsubscribe from their marketing garbage, I&rsquo;m required to relinquish some of my benefits of the program</strong>. Reading through the CAN-SPAM act I can&rsquo;t actually find a requirement being broken. The practice seems to be legit albeit highly annoying and borderline shady.</p>

<p>The text:</p>

<p><em>If you unsubscribe from email updates, your benefits will be reduced to one AAdvantage mile per dollar spent. Only members who have signed up to receive emails and provide a valid, deliverable email address will be eligible for our top dining reward levels.</em></p>

<p>Thank goodness for Gmail filters. Straight to trash you go AAdvantage.</p>

<p>On a related note I should call out two other culprits in the marketing email arena. I have now attempted to unsubscribe from <strong>Fandago&rsquo;s</strong> marketing mail over 5 times in the past two years and I am still getting them (well my trash is getting them, occasionally I check to see if they ever removed me off their list). I am <a href="http://twitter.com/mattdeclaire/status/26786468600">not the only one</a>.  I recently unsubscribed from Best Buy&rsquo;s mail and of course get the &ldquo;We have ten days to process your unsubscribing&rdquo;, even though it should theoretically take less than a second (<a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-do-companies-often-take-10-days-to-respond-to-email-unsubscribe-requests">although there are a few valid reasons for a ten day wait period</a>). I swear in the ten day period since I&rsquo;ve unsubscribed, the rate of emails from Best Buy has doubled. They are milking me for every last penny.</p>
