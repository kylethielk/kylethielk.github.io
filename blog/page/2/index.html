<p>Myanmar. Oppressive Government. Remarkably friendly and welcoming people.</p>

<p>Two weeks before our scheduled arrival Myanmar was struck by 5 separate (minor, but still) bombings. I am so glad we did not cancel (although we almost did, numerous times).</p>

<p>Myanmar truly is largely unaffected by tourism and that is a fantastic thing. Take stunning natural beauty, throw in delicious food, millions of smiling faces genuinely happy to have you and you have one heck of a place to visit. Highly recommended.</p>

			Thailand. Well Touristed.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/thailand-featured.jpg" title="Thailand Roses." alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just going to be up front about it. Thailand was my least favorite of the 8 countries we visited in Southeast Asia. It is the most touristed (which has its perks though when you are looking for some western amenities), had the least friendly people and the most scams. It did however have some of the best street food and local beer.</p>

<p>The number of scams force you to constantly be on guard making it hard to relax. I was lied to multiple times, approached by scammers/hawkers constantly, double charged in taxis and overall felt the least welcomed by the locals.</p>

<p>That being said there is a lot to do in Thailand and you can do so cheaply thanks to well developed infrastructure. For those into shopping, it can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>

<p>Granted I have heard numerous people say the same about Vietnam, a country I loved. I am sure living there for 5 months has made me somewhat biased and perhaps I was simply unfortunate in my overall experience with Thailand.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/philippines-featured.jpg" title="Philippines Dog Eyes" alt="" /></p>

<p>Palawan was one of the highlights of our 9 month SE Asia journey. Some of the most stunning scenery, friendliest people and for the most affordable prices. The people are seriously friendly (Port Barton gets the nod for the most friendly people of our entire trip). Fresh seafood is abundant. Our favorite meals were fish caught 5 minutes prior and cooked on a tiny grill on the stern of the boat. The surrounding islands of Coron are the most beautiful I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Puerto Princesa is the main point of entry into Palawan. An energetic city on the rise. Getting to Port Barton during the rainy season&hellip;.good luck. Â One of our favorite places, ever. We thought El Nido had the most amazing islands anywhere&hellip;.until we went to Coron. Â Diving inside japanese shipwrecks? Check. Crystal clear freshwater lakes? Check. Crystal clear reefs? Check.</p>

<p>Food. Varied, delicious food. This is what I will remember about Malaysia. The food courts (different than food courts we know in the US) are teeming with options. Indian, Chinese and Malay all simmer together to create a hodgepodge of deliciousness. Most dishes for under $2.</p>

<p>Our trip to Malaysia was short at just 2 weeks but we were able to cover quite a bit of ground. Â We started in Langkawi, headed to Penang, and finally crossed over to Malaysian Borneo (Kuching).</p>

<p>Langkawi was a beautiful island retreat, Penang a teeming city with more than enough options for the tourist, and Borneo was a nature lover&rsquo;s dream.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/labuan-bajo-featured.jpg" title="Labuan Bajo Beach Header" alt="" /></p>

<p>Labuan Bajo is the main launching point for excursions to Komodo National Park. There is a tiny airport a few KM from town (walking into town took us about 50 minutes, not recommended during the heat of the day). The town itself has little draw other than a place to stay and grab a meal. Following the trend of Bali and Lombok during high season expect to pay a lot for a little, especially for accommodations (compared to the rest of Southeast Asia).</p>

<p>The main attraction is the diving/snorkeling/trekking/sight-seeing on the surrounding islands. The scenery is phenomenal, the water crystal clear and the aquatic life abundant. Its a snorkeler&rsquo;s and diver&rsquo;s dream. Â Seraya island was the best snorkeling I&rsquo;ve ever done by far.</p>

<p>Labuan Bajo can be difficult to get to but definitely worth the effort. Just keep in mind the expectation that a boat is required for anything of interest.</p>

			7 Habits of Highly Successful People, 96.05% Too Long.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Date Read: October 11 &ndash; 15th, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1455892823">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I understand that Stephen R. Covey is highy respected and I&rsquo;m sure he rakes in $5,000+/hour consulting fees but really this book for me still falls into the &lsquo;self help&rsquo; genre where most information is common sense and that which isn&rsquo;t can be found on any &lsquo;self help&rsquo; blog for free.</p>

<p>That is not to say I do not agree with the underlying premise of each of the 7 habits. In fact Habit 1 (&ldquo;Be Proactive&rdquo;) and 5 (&ldquo;Seek first to understand, then to be understood&rdquo;) in particular I think we should all be mindful of every day. Habit 6 is titled &ldquo;Synergize&rdquo;, Habit 7 is titled &ldquo;Sharpen the Saw&rdquo;. No explanation is needed as to why &lsquo;fluff&rsquo; is the first word that comes to mind.</p>

<p>This is how I imagine Covey&rsquo;s conversation with his publisher after coming up with the idea for the book.</p>

<p>Covey: &ldquo;I have this great idea for a new book&rdquo;.
Publisher: &ldquo;Excellent, how far along in the process are you?&rdquo;
Covey: &ldquo;Finished.&rdquo;
Publisher: &ldquo;How long is it?&rdquo;
Covey: &ldquo;15 pages.&rdquo;
Publisher: &ldquo;What? We can&rsquo;t sell a 15 page pamphlet for $19.99. Fluff it up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>1 Month Later:</p>

<p>Covey: &ldquo;Ok. The book is complete. Still 15 pages of good information, but now with 365 pages of fluff as an added bonus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seriously read this <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seven_Habits_Study_Guide/Quick_overview_of_the_seven_habits">WikiBooks&#8217;&lsquo; summary</a>, and save yourself the time and money.

<p>After hearing such good things about Ender&rsquo;s Game I was afraid my expectations were set too high and I would be disappointed. My general distaste for science fiction healthily balanced out the high expectations though and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it.</p>

<p>What I like about Ender&rsquo;s Game is that the science fiction complements the story and the characters, not the other way around. The story and character development comes first, science fiction is simply there to help.</p>

<p>The children in Ender&rsquo;s game are young but their opinions and thoughts are of that of someone much older. For me this was less believable than the science fiction. Adding five years to all of the characters would not minimize the effect nor would it detract from the point but would lend itself to a more credible premise. This is my one complaint.</p>

<p>The story is fantastic. It flows very well and is enjoyable the whole time. In fact I found myself wishing it was longer. I can understand why it is a book people read multiple times, I already want to read it again.</p>

<p>Definitely in my top 5 fiction books (granted that list is barely over 5, but I don&rsquo;t see it dropping out either).</p>

<p>Read: September 20 â 25th, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Malcolm Gladwell is a fantastic writer and story teller. I imagine this is why his books sell so well and he has so many fans. I read Outliers in just a few days, granted it is a short book but I was also on a beach in the Philippines and I frequently had to remind myself of this fact so I didn&rsquo;t spend too much time in the room reading.</p>

<p>I was going to give the book a 5 star rating. I bought into Outliers hook line and sinker. The book basically argues that the general consensus the public and the media has of highly successful people (especially those that came form a less than favorable background) clawing and fighting themselves to the top through sheer determination and genius alone is a fallacy. Gladwell sets out to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; that it is in fact determination and hard work coupled with very fortunate circumstances and a lot of help from other people. The premise is very thought provoking and presents many case studies (read: South Korean Airlines) that are fascinating.</p>

<p>As a quick example Gladwell points out that in the world of Canadian Hockey, a large percentage of the elite players were born in the same few months. As children this meant they were older than their peers in the same leagues and thus more developed and larger. This small advantage when younger is quickly magnified as the better players receive more training and attention. This ties into Gladwell&rsquo;s 10,000 hour theory then; since the players receive more training and attention, they reach the 10,000 hour mark much quicker and thus become the &lsquo;elite&rsquo; players. The elite players are the elite because of one small advantage as a child that creates a snowball effect throughout their life.</p>

<p>I was a little behind with this book summary, I&rsquo;m writing it a few weeks after finishing the book. The other day I completely by chance stumbled upon an article by Paul Raeburn on MIT&rsquo;s Science Journal: <a href="http://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/10/should-we-stop-believing-malcolm-gladwel">Should we stop believing Malcolm Gladwell</a>Â and this follow-up: <a href="http://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/10/malcolm-gladwell-speaks-can-narrative-be">Malcolm Gladwell speaks: Can narrative be misused in journalism?</a></p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I am a story-teller, and I look to academic research â¦ for ways of augmenting story-telling. &#8230;weâre obsessed with things like coherence, consistency, neatness of argument. Readers are indifferent to those things.&#8221; -Malcolm Gladwell

&#8220;All writing about social science need not be presented with the formality and precision of the academic world. There is a place for storytelling, in all of its messiness.&#8221; -Malcolm Gladwell</blockquote>


<p>Gladwell absolutely presents his work in Outliers as fact, as well-researched and verified fact (which I assume he does in his other books as well). These comments from Gladwell himself seem to directly contradict this. They leave me feeling slightly betrayed. Gladwell&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/10/malcolm_gladwell_s_david_and_goliath_he_explains_why_christopher_chabris.html">response to these criticisms</a> does absolutely nothing to disprove his critics and simply tells them to &ldquo;calm down&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Outliers must be taken as a story, a very good story. Do not take it as well researched journalism or fact even if it is presented that way and you will be much better for it.</p>

Read: September 2 &ndash; 20th, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stand-Stephen-King/dp/0307947300/">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I have always wanted to read a Stephen King book and now that I&rsquo;ve committed myself to reading <a href="http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/26-books-in-26-weeks/">26 books in 26 weeks</a>, there could not not be a better time.  Stephen King&rsquo;s collection of works is quite large and with very little prior knowledge of any of them I simply chose the one that appeared to be the most popular, The Stand.</p>

<p>The fact that it is over 800 pages is a little intimidating. In fact I attempted to read the first Game of Thrones book which is similar in length and only made it 60% of the way through.  Fortunately the number of characters and story lines that the reader must keep straight is far more manageable in The Stand. Game of Thrones is just far too difficult to read unless done so in a near continuous span of time.</p>

<p>Stephen King&rsquo;s style of writing in The Stand is simple but descriptive. I found the story intriguing and the way in which the character&rsquo;s stories were wound together made it that much easier to read and thus enjoy. I never once found myself bored or at risk of  losing interest. There were multiple times that I had to force myself to take a break.</p>

<p>A minor complaint with the book is that there are a few major questions left unanswered. The supernatural aspects of the story are never really presented with a cause or explanation.  They simply happen and we have to accept them.</p>

<p>In order to maintain a level of variety (and ensure I can actually finish 26 books by the end of the year) I will probably not include another Stephen King novel in the list as much as I would like to.  I do however plan on picking up more of them for pleasure after this project is complete.</p>
