Read: September 2 &ndash; 20th, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stand-Stephen-King/dp/0307947300/">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I have always wanted to read a Stephen King book and now that I&rsquo;ve committed myself to reading <a href="http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/26-books-in-26-weeks/">26 books in 26 weeks</a>, there could not not be a better time.  Stephen King&rsquo;s collection of works is quite large and with very little prior knowledge of any of them I simply chose the one that appeared to be the most popular, The Stand.</p>

<p>The fact that it is over 800 pages is a little intimidating. In fact I attempted to read the first Game of Thrones book which is similar in length and only made it 60% of the way through.  Fortunately the number of characters and story lines that the reader must keep straight is far more manageable in The Stand. Game of Thrones is just far too difficult to read unless done so in a near continuous span of time.</p>

<p>Stephen King&rsquo;s style of writing in The Stand is simple but descriptive. I found the story intriguing and the way in which the character&rsquo;s stories were wound together made it that much easier to read and thus enjoy. I never once found myself bored or at risk of  losing interest. There were multiple times that I had to force myself to take a break.</p>

<p>A minor complaint with the book is that there are a few major questions left unanswered. The supernatural aspects of the story are never really presented with a cause or explanation.  They simply happen and we have to accept them.</p>

<p>In order to maintain a level of variety (and ensure I can actually finish 26 books by the end of the year) I will probably not include another Stephen King novel in the list as much as I would like to.  I do however plan on picking up more of them for pleasure after this project is complete.</p>

<p>While in Lombok, Indonesia we made the very rash decision to hike to the top of Mt Rinjani. It was three days and two nights of stunning views and never ending lactic acid.</p>

<p>This was not only one of our most careless decisions but also our best. Exhilarating, exhausting, and absolutely worth every moment of agony. In those three days we walked over 25km with a total vertical distance of over 8km. We were wildly unprepared and definitely paid for it. Our recovery period consisted of two days of nothing but sleeping and feasting.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, each hiker has a porter who carries their tent, cooking supplies and all food and water. They carry this while wearing flip-flops and in easily half the time it takes us normal people. Demoralizing and motivating at the same time.</p>

		<p><img src="/media/images/gili-meno-featured.jpg" title="Gili Meno Beach Header" alt="" /></p>

<p>After spending eight days in Bali our next stop was Lembongan Island. An uneventful 45 minute boat ride (Perama, 100,000 IDR/person) and you are there. There is an ATM in Lembongan but being the only one it is often empty, so its important to bring cash. Also accommodation is limited. Â We showed up with no reservation and really struggled to find a place to stay. The island itself is gorgeous and its easy to rent a motorbike and tour the beaches.</p>

<p>While there I took a 3 day PADI open water certification course @ <a href="http://www.lembongandivecenter.com/">Lembongan Dive Center</a> and am now a certified diver (for a cost of Â $385)! Â All other time was spent sun bathing and eating.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/Jungut-Batu-Beach.jpg" title="Jungut Batu Beach, where most ferries drop off." alt="Jungut Batu Beach, where most ferries drop off." /></p>

<p>After Lembongan we headed to Gili Air via another ferry. This ferry was a little longer at 2 hours and significantly more expensive (300,000IDR/person). The gili&rsquo;s are phenomenal. The most beautiful beaches by far of our trip so far. Crystal clear water, picturesque mountains in the background and bright white sand. During high season demand outstrips supply though and the accommodation prices are significantly higher than we expected. Like Lembongan we arrived with no reservation and really struggled to find a room.</p>

<p>We stayed on Gili Air and took a day trip to Gili Meno. Meno is even more beautiful and far less developed than Air. Definitely worth a visit.</p>

<p>Lombok is only 20 minutes from mainland Gili Air by boat (and only 10,000 IDR/person, drops off at Bangsal). Our destination of Senggigi was an hour cab drive away (always, always negotiate we got it down from 300,000IDR to 100,000IDR). Senggigi was kind of a let down after the Gilis. Mediocre beaches and super touristy. Fortunately it was only the launching point for perhaps our most memorable experience yet&hellip;.climbing Mt Rinjani (full post to follow).</p>

<p>Read: Jul 30 &ndash; August 24, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0547848412">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Life of Pi is a quick read. Life of Pi took me 25 days to read, an average of 14.24 pages a day. It certainly put a damper on my attempt to read 26 books in 26 weeks (that and I&rsquo;m currently reading the 800+ page &ldquo;The Stand&rdquo; by Stephen King) and I now have a lot of ground to make up. This was a particularly busy month (excuses, excuses) but the point is when I could actually make time the book was easy to get through and the total time to finish the book is not at all indicative of the time spent actually reading. There are very few characters and only one plot line to follow so very little cognitive power is required.</p>

<p>Life of PI starts off well. Pi walks us through his various encounters with Hinduism, Christianity and Islam and his attempts to be all three at once. His family dynamics and the various lessons he learns from them as well, which quickly and nicely set the stage for the meat of the book.</p>

<p>The majority of the book takes place on PI&rsquo;s lifeboat with his tiger shipmate, Richard Parker. At first the struggle to survive is enthralling, I didn&rsquo;t want to stop reading. Unfortuately it drags on, and on. I found myself losing interest fairly quickly. There were a few bright spots that brought me back in (the floating island), but mostly I was looking forward to the end.</p>

<p>The end comes and finishes off the story nicely. Its a story of hope and it makes you feel good despite the not so pleasant circumstances. So even though I lost interest the ending &lsquo;sort of&rsquo; saves the book.</p>

<p>I watched the movie the day after completing the book (which is actually the first time I&rsquo;ve ever read a book first). My recommendation is to watch it and skip the book. The movie is visually stunning and does an excellent job of condensing the book into a 2 hour film.</p>

			Bali, or Second Europe</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/ricefield-featured.jpg" title="Bali Ricefield Header" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a five month stretch in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam it was time for some rest and relaxation. The month of August was spent in Indonesia. The first week of which we planted ourselves firmly in Bali, or as we like to call it &ldquo;Second Europe&rdquo; because literally everyone there is from Europe.</p>

<p>Ubud was our first stop and also one of our favorites of the entire month. Â So much to do in close proximity (which is nice because most everywhere else in Indonesia requires a very long car/bus/boat ride and in most cases a combination of the three). Â The Balinese people truly are some of the most friendly people in the world. Their island is crawling with tourists (August is their busiest month of the year) yet we always felt very warmly welcomed.</p>

<p>Without all the traffic and crowds (easily avoided by going during a less busy season) Ubud is near perfect. Definitely a must see in Indonesia.</p>

<p>The first morning we took a walk along what is known as the &lsquo;Campuhan Ridge Walk&rsquo;. A beautiful walk through a hilly forest that ends in rice fields, a few restaurants and many independent artist shops. Highly recommended and free.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/CampuhanRidgeWalk.jpg" title="Campuhan Ridge Walk" alt="Campuhan Ridge Walk" /></p>

<p>The Monkey Forest is probably the biggest &lsquo;tourist&rsquo; attraction in town and even though we read many mixed reviews (and were warned by the locals) we checked it out anyway. Its walking distance from most places in Ubud. The monkeys are certainly as cheeky and mischievous as advertised. They won&rsquo;t hesitate to climb up your leg and pick through your hair for fleas or search your bag for food. Its easy enough to marvel from afar though by simply staying far,far away from those purposely trying to feed the monkeys.</p>

<p>One of the days we hired a private car to take us around for the afternoon ($45 for car and driver). We visited the Elephant Cave (beautiful grounds but the cave itself is so-so), a few Hindu temples (unlike most of Indonesia which is Muslim, Bali is largely Hindu), Mt Batur and the <a href="http://www.elephantsafariparklodge.com/">Elephant Safari Park</a>.</p>

<p>Christina and I were both super hesitant about the Elephant Safari Park, we have both heard horror stories of mistreated and abused elephants taken advantage of (not at Elephant Safari Park in specific, just in general). Thankfully we were pleasantly surprised. The elephants were all happy and very well taken care of and you can up close and personal with them. Definitely a highlight of Bali for us both.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Sanur, Bali. Often referred to as &ldquo;Snore&rdquo;, this place pretty much lives up to its name. Plenty of western (and local) restaurants, a mediocre beach but most importantly the primary harbor for all boats headed to Nusa Lembongan! I spent our three days finishing up my final contract so there is little pictorial evidence of our stay (not that there is much worth shooting). Here is one final shot from the beach in Sanur.</p>

			The Art of Non-Conformity</a>

		<p><img src="http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Art-of-Non-Conformity-t.jpg" title="The Art of Non-Conformity" alt="The Art of Non-Conformity" /></p>

<p>Read: July 25 &ndash; 29, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Non-Conformity-Rules-Change/dp/0399536108">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I really wanted to like it. The basic premise of non-conformity is something that crosses my mind daily (I did move to Vietnam for 6 months and plan to work for myself) and something I completely agree with. Even with this bias going in, I was still extremely disappointed.</p>

<p>The book reads like one long blog post, or many blog posts strung together (there are many typos, some glaringly obvious). Chris&#8217; writing style really turned me off from the start.</p>

<p>A large part of the book is spent dedicated to himself and his story. Yes its awesome that you&rsquo;ve visited 193 countries, but we don&rsquo;t really need to hear about throughout the entire book (he even mentions how he cut an entire section on travel hacking, thank goodness ). Â His motivation as stated, &ldquo;I travel for the sake of travel itself&rdquo; just seems wrong. How much can you really experience other cultures when you visit 193 countries before the time you are 35?</p>

<p>Chris even directly refers to his &ldquo;amazon.com reviews&rdquo; for the book which comes across as extremely tacky.</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;I&#8217;ll deserve one-star reviews on Amazon.com&#8230;</blockquote>


<p>and</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;Amazon.com reviewers, here is your chance to nail me&#8230;</blockquote>


<p>Chris general view on investing and saving money is dismissive and considered to be an unnecessary delaying of gratification. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have &lsquo;struck it rich&rsquo; in the blogging popularity contest and gotten book deals out of it. In this respect I think his views are irresponsible and dangerous.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to read his take on how our work effects other people. Â I completely agree that the world is not a zero sum game. Success shouldn&rsquo;t come at the cost of someone else. Â The most rewarding work is in fact that which helps others.</p>

<p>The book is short and its an easy read. I finished it in a couple of sittings. I agree with and try to follow most of the principles set forth in the book, but I did not like they way they are presented. Nothing is presented that can&rsquo;t be read for free on hundred of travel and entrepreneurial blogs.</p>

<p>The Art of Non-Conformity was unfortunately a let down and not one I would recommend to anyone else.</p>

<p>This was the first fiction I&rsquo;ve read in a very long time. Well that is not entirely true, I halfheartedly attempted to read &ldquo;A Game of Throne&#8221;s but only made it 60% of the way through. Speaking of which that book is long, way too long.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t put the darn book down. If it weren&rsquo;t for those pesky responsibilities I could have read the entire thing in one sitting.</p>

<p>Each chapter is dedicated to a different character. At first the characters and chapters seem fairly independent of each other. Slowly there stories are naturally wound together. I knew this going into the book (I really have to stop reading so many reviews before starting a book and spoiling half the fun) and was Â wary it would lead to a fragmented, poorly developed story. I&rsquo;m a big fan of deep character development. Fortunately the stories tie together nicely.</p>

<p>It is easy to read and the story really drew me in. I almost wish the book was longer so it wouldn&rsquo;t have ended so soon but I guess its better to end on a high note before the reader loses interest.</p>

<p>There is not much else I have to say. Just a thoroughly enjoyable novel.</p>

<p>I read this one quickly. I was extremely drawn in the whole time. Almost completely unaware of the events that transpired in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge this book was both riveting and educational.</p>

<p>The events that transpired at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, that led to the death of close to a quarter of Cambodia&rsquo;s population were devastating and this book does an excellent job at bringing them to light.</p>

<p>The entire book is written as a narrative in the voice of the author as a child (she was 5 when the events start). I personally found this choice to be perfect for myself as a reader. It personalizes the events and you can&rsquo;t help but feel as if you are there experiencing everything as well. The story is truly devastating.</p>

<p>The one criticism I have is in regards to the author&rsquo;s choice to write it in the voice of her as a child (yes, I know I just said it was a good choice, but hear me out). The days and events are described in such detail that it seems to me to be impossible that she would be able to remember that many things as Â five to nine year old child. Plus its well documented how sketchy our memories are from traumatic experiences. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how much of the story has been &lsquo;dramatized&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Other than that it was an excellent book. If I struggle to put a book down its definitely a good sign, and this was definitely one of those. Â  Even though the tone throughout the book is one of hope, be warned that it is very depressing and sad at times.</p>

			Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It</a>

<p>Read: July 8 &ndash; 14, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307474259">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Why We Get Fat was an eye opening book. The basic premise is that Foods rich in Carbohydrates cause a spike in insulin, a spike in insulin causes excess fat storage. Since excess fat storage causes so many illnesses such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease it should be eliminated. Therefore we should eliminate or minimize the amount of carbohydrates in our diet.</p>

<p>This makes sense. The part that was a little hard to swallow (hard to swallow since I&rsquo;ve believed the opposite for so long) is that in order to make up for the loss of calories in the carbohydrates you are no longer eating, they should be replaced by proteins and fats, mostly from animal products.</p>

<p>In retrospect I think I bought into the &lsquo;No Animal Products &rsquo; bandwagon with far too little research of my own. The studies that the no animal products proponents often cite are often misleading, taken out of context or improperly performed.</p>

<p>For example they love to cite a study in which rats were given a diet of 20% protein or 5% protein. The rats who were give 20% protein had higher rates of cancer. What they always neglect to point out is that the 5% protein rats died significantly younger than the 20% rats, so of course they never had the chance to develop cancer. They died younger because they were literally starved of protein.</p>

<p>The book itself is easy to read and not overly dry like I was expecting. It definitely sparked a renewed interest in paying attention to what I eat, which is always a good thing.</p>

<p>I hate reading. Rather, I <em>hated</em> reading.</p>

<p>Something, somewhere has a sparked a passion for reading and now I actually want to do it. I even read a fiction&hellip;and liked it!</p>

<p>One of the many benefits of living and travelling internationally is an abundance of downtime. I plan on filing this downtime with books, lots and lots of books. The timing works out that I have right around 6 months Â before resuming &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life (not to say I don&rsquo;t plan on continuing to read voraciously, or even that travelling isn&rsquo;t a normal life).</p>

<p>Setting a goal is a good way to guarantee success and thus here it is: <strong>26 Books in 26 Weeks</strong>. That might not sound like a lot, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I haven&rsquo;t read that many books in my entire life (to completion).</p>

<p><del>Each book read will be accompanied by its own post. Â This will force me to actually &lsquo;read&rsquo; each book (as opposed to my bad habit of skimming and thinking of something totally unrelated at the same time, most often work) and will serve as a form of public accountability to keep me on point.</del> Â OK so slight update. I&rsquo;ve decided that this won&rsquo;t be happening. I&rsquo;m still going to read 26 books, but I&rsquo;m no longer writing summaries for them. Unfortunately there are only so many hours in the day and I&rsquo;ve got more important things to occupy them with.</p>

<p>I generally favor non-fiction books, but part of this challenge for me is to branch out and read some fiction. I hope to strike a good balance between the two but more than likely the list will be slanted towards non-fiction.</p>

<p>I decided to set this goal today, but I&rsquo;m actually going to back date it to July 8 which means by January 8th, 2014 I need to have finished book #26. Â Fortunately I&rsquo;m already ahead of schedule ;)</p>
