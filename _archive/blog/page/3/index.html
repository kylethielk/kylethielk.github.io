<p>After hearing such good things about Ender&rsquo;s Game I was afraid my expectations were set too high and I would be disappointed. My general distaste for science fiction healthily balanced out the high expectations though and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it.</p>

<p>What I like about Ender&rsquo;s Game is that the science fiction complements the story and the characters, not the other way around. The story and character development comes first, science fiction is simply there to help.</p>

<p>The children in Ender&rsquo;s game are young but their opinions and thoughts are of that of someone much older. For me this was less believable than the science fiction. Adding five years to all of the characters would not minimize the effect nor would it detract from the point but would lend itself to a more credible premise. This is my one complaint.</p>

<p>The story is fantastic. It flows very well and is enjoyable the whole time. In fact I found myself wishing it was longer. I can understand why it is a book people read multiple times, I already want to read it again.</p>

<p>Definitely in my top 5 fiction books (granted that list is barely over 5, but I don&rsquo;t see it dropping out either).</p>

<p>Read: September 20 – 25th, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Malcolm Gladwell is a fantastic writer and story teller. I imagine this is why his books sell so well and he has so many fans. I read Outliers in just a few days, granted it is a short book but I was also on a beach in the Philippines and I frequently had to remind myself of this fact so I didn&rsquo;t spend too much time in the room reading.</p>

<p>I was going to give the book a 5 star rating. I bought into Outliers hook line and sinker. The book basically argues that the general consensus the public and the media has of highly successful people (especially those that came form a less than favorable background) clawing and fighting themselves to the top through sheer determination and genius alone is a fallacy. Gladwell sets out to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; that it is in fact determination and hard work coupled with very fortunate circumstances and a lot of help from other people. The premise is very thought provoking and presents many case studies (read: South Korean Airlines) that are fascinating.</p>

<p>As a quick example Gladwell points out that in the world of Canadian Hockey, a large percentage of the elite players were born in the same few months. As children this meant they were older than their peers in the same leagues and thus more developed and larger. This small advantage when younger is quickly magnified as the better players receive more training and attention. This ties into Gladwell&rsquo;s 10,000 hour theory then; since the players receive more training and attention, they reach the 10,000 hour mark much quicker and thus become the &lsquo;elite&rsquo; players. The elite players are the elite because of one small advantage as a child that creates a snowball effect throughout their life.</p>

<p>I was a little behind with this book summary, I&rsquo;m writing it a few weeks after finishing the book. The other day I completely by chance stumbled upon an article by Paul Raeburn on MIT&rsquo;s Science Journal: <a href="http://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/10/should-we-stop-believing-malcolm-gladwel">Should we stop believing Malcolm Gladwell</a> and this follow-up: <a href="http://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/10/malcolm-gladwell-speaks-can-narrative-be">Malcolm Gladwell speaks: Can narrative be misused in journalism?</a></p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I am a story-teller, and I look to academic research … for ways of augmenting story-telling. &#8230;we’re obsessed with things like coherence, consistency, neatness of argument. Readers are indifferent to those things.&#8221; -Malcolm Gladwell

&#8220;All writing about social science need not be presented with the formality and precision of the academic world. There is a place for storytelling, in all of its messiness.&#8221; -Malcolm Gladwell</blockquote>


<p>Gladwell absolutely presents his work in Outliers as fact, as well-researched and verified fact (which I assume he does in his other books as well). These comments from Gladwell himself seem to directly contradict this. They leave me feeling slightly betrayed. Gladwell&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/10/malcolm_gladwell_s_david_and_goliath_he_explains_why_christopher_chabris.html">response to these criticisms</a> does absolutely nothing to disprove his critics and simply tells them to &ldquo;calm down&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Outliers must be taken as a story, a very good story. Do not take it as well researched journalism or fact even if it is presented that way and you will be much better for it.</p>

Read: September 2 &ndash; 20th, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stand-Stephen-King/dp/0307947300/">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I have always wanted to read a Stephen King book and now that I&rsquo;ve committed myself to reading <a href="http://www.kylethielk.com/blog/26-books-in-26-weeks/">26 books in 26 weeks</a>, there could not not be a better time.  Stephen King&rsquo;s collection of works is quite large and with very little prior knowledge of any of them I simply chose the one that appeared to be the most popular, The Stand.</p>

<p>The fact that it is over 800 pages is a little intimidating. In fact I attempted to read the first Game of Thrones book which is similar in length and only made it 60% of the way through.  Fortunately the number of characters and story lines that the reader must keep straight is far more manageable in The Stand. Game of Thrones is just far too difficult to read unless done so in a near continuous span of time.</p>

<p>Stephen King&rsquo;s style of writing in The Stand is simple but descriptive. I found the story intriguing and the way in which the character&rsquo;s stories were wound together made it that much easier to read and thus enjoy. I never once found myself bored or at risk of  losing interest. There were multiple times that I had to force myself to take a break.</p>

<p>A minor complaint with the book is that there are a few major questions left unanswered. The supernatural aspects of the story are never really presented with a cause or explanation.  They simply happen and we have to accept them.</p>

<p>In order to maintain a level of variety (and ensure I can actually finish 26 books by the end of the year) I will probably not include another Stephen King novel in the list as much as I would like to.  I do however plan on picking up more of them for pleasure after this project is complete.</p>

<p>While in Lombok, Indonesia we made the very rash decision to hike to the top of Mt Rinjani. It was three days and two nights of stunning views and never ending lactic acid.</p>

<p>This was not only one of our most careless decisions but also our best. Exhilarating, exhausting, and absolutely worth every moment of agony. In those three days we walked over 25km with a total vertical distance of over 8km. We were wildly unprepared and definitely paid for it. Our recovery period consisted of two days of nothing but sleeping and feasting.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, each hiker has a porter who carries their tent, cooking supplies and all food and water. They carry this while wearing flip-flops and in easily half the time it takes us normal people. Demoralizing and motivating at the same time.</p>

<p>After spending eight days in Bali our next stop was Lembongan Island. An uneventful 45 minute boat ride (Perama, 100,000 IDR/person) and you are there. There is an ATM in Lembongan but being the only one it is often empty, so its important to bring cash. Also accommodation is limited.  We showed up with no reservation and really struggled to find a place to stay. The island itself is gorgeous and its easy to rent a motorbike and tour the beaches.</p>

<p>While there I took a 3 day PADI open water certification course @ <a href="http://www.lembongandivecenter.com/">Lembongan Dive Center</a> and am now a certified diver (for a cost of  $385)!  All other time was spent sun bathing and eating.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/Jungut-Batu-Beach.jpg" title="Jungut Batu Beach, where most ferries drop off." alt="Jungut Batu Beach, where most ferries drop off." /></p>

<p>After Lembongan we headed to Gili Air via another ferry. This ferry was a little longer at 2 hours and significantly more expensive (300,000IDR/person). The gili&rsquo;s are phenomenal. The most beautiful beaches by far of our trip so far. Crystal clear water, picturesque mountains in the background and bright white sand. During high season demand outstrips supply though and the accommodation prices are significantly higher than we expected. Like Lembongan we arrived with no reservation and really struggled to find a room.</p>

<p>We stayed on Gili Air and took a day trip to Gili Meno. Meno is even more beautiful and far less developed than Air. Definitely worth a visit.</p>

<p>Lombok is only 20 minutes from mainland Gili Air by boat (and only 10,000 IDR/person, drops off at Bangsal). Our destination of Senggigi was an hour cab drive away (always, always negotiate we got it down from 300,000IDR to 100,000IDR). Senggigi was kind of a let down after the Gilis. Mediocre beaches and super touristy. Fortunately it was only the launching point for perhaps our most memorable experience yet&hellip;.climbing Mt Rinjani (full post to follow).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0547848412">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>Life of Pi is a quick read. Life of Pi took me 25 days to read, an average of 14.24 pages a day. It certainly put a damper on my attempt to read 26 books in 26 weeks (that and I&rsquo;m currently reading the 800+ page &ldquo;The Stand&rdquo; by Stephen King) and I now have a lot of ground to make up. This was a particularly busy month (excuses, excuses) but the point is when I could actually make time the book was easy to get through and the total time to finish the book is not at all indicative of the time spent actually reading. There are very few characters and only one plot line to follow so very little cognitive power is required.</p>

<p>Life of PI starts off well. Pi walks us through his various encounters with Hinduism, Christianity and Islam and his attempts to be all three at once. His family dynamics and the various lessons he learns from them as well, which quickly and nicely set the stage for the meat of the book.</p>

<p>The majority of the book takes place on PI&rsquo;s lifeboat with his tiger shipmate, Richard Parker. At first the struggle to survive is enthralling, I didn&rsquo;t want to stop reading. Unfortuately it drags on, and on. I found myself losing interest fairly quickly. There were a few bright spots that brought me back in (the floating island), but mostly I was looking forward to the end.</p>

<p>The end comes and finishes off the story nicely. Its a story of hope and it makes you feel good despite the not so pleasant circumstances. So even though I lost interest the ending &lsquo;sort of&rsquo; saves the book.</p>

<p>I watched the movie the day after completing the book (which is actually the first time I&rsquo;ve ever read a book first). My recommendation is to watch it and skip the book. The movie is visually stunning and does an excellent job of condensing the book into a 2 hour film.</p>

			Bali, or Second Europe</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/media/images/ricefield-featured.jpg" title="Bali Ricefield Header" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a five month stretch in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam it was time for some rest and relaxation. The month of August was spent in Indonesia. The first week of which we planted ourselves firmly in Bali, or as we like to call it &ldquo;Second Europe&rdquo; because literally everyone there is from Europe.</p>

<p>Ubud was our first stop and also one of our favorites of the entire month.  So much to do in close proximity (which is nice because most everywhere else in Indonesia requires a very long car/bus/boat ride and in most cases a combination of the three).  The Balinese people truly are some of the most friendly people in the world. Their island is crawling with tourists (August is their busiest month of the year) yet we always felt very warmly welcomed.</p>

<p>Without all the traffic and crowds (easily avoided by going during a less busy season) Ubud is near perfect. Definitely a must see in Indonesia.</p>

<p>The first morning we took a walk along what is known as the &lsquo;Campuhan Ridge Walk&rsquo;. A beautiful walk through a hilly forest that ends in rice fields, a few restaurants and many independent artist shops. Highly recommended and free.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/CampuhanRidgeWalk.jpg" title="Campuhan Ridge Walk" alt="Campuhan Ridge Walk" /></p>

<p>The Monkey Forest is probably the biggest &lsquo;tourist&rsquo; attraction in town and even though we read many mixed reviews (and were warned by the locals) we checked it out anyway. Its walking distance from most places in Ubud. The monkeys are certainly as cheeky and mischievous as advertised. They won&rsquo;t hesitate to climb up your leg and pick through your hair for fleas or search your bag for food. Its easy enough to marvel from afar though by simply staying far,far away from those purposely trying to feed the monkeys.</p>

<p>One of the days we hired a private car to take us around for the afternoon ($45 for car and driver). We visited the Elephant Cave (beautiful grounds but the cave itself is so-so), a few Hindu temples (unlike most of Indonesia which is Muslim, Bali is largely Hindu), Mt Batur and the <a href="http://www.elephantsafariparklodge.com/">Elephant Safari Park</a>.</p>

<p>Christina and I were both super hesitant about the Elephant Safari Park, we have both heard horror stories of mistreated and abused elephants taken advantage of (not at Elephant Safari Park in specific, just in general). Thankfully we were pleasantly surprised. The elephants were all happy and very well taken care of and you can up close and personal with them. Definitely a highlight of Bali for us both.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Sanur, Bali. Often referred to as &ldquo;Snore&rdquo;, this place pretty much lives up to its name. Plenty of western (and local) restaurants, a mediocre beach but most importantly the primary harbor for all boats headed to Nusa Lembongan! I spent our three days finishing up my final contract so there is little pictorial evidence of our stay (not that there is much worth shooting). Here is one final shot from the beach in Sanur.</p>

<p>Read: July 25 &ndash; 29, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Non-Conformity-Rules-Change/dp/0399536108">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I really wanted to like it. The basic premise of non-conformity is something that crosses my mind daily (I did move to Vietnam for 6 months and plan to work for myself) and something I completely agree with. Even with this bias going in, I was still extremely disappointed.</p>

<p>The book reads like one long blog post, or many blog posts strung together (there are many typos, some glaringly obvious). Chris&#8217; writing style really turned me off from the start.</p>

<p>A large part of the book is spent dedicated to himself and his story. Yes its awesome that you&rsquo;ve visited 193 countries, but we don&rsquo;t really need to hear about throughout the entire book (he even mentions how he cut an entire section on travel hacking, thank goodness ).  His motivation as stated, &ldquo;I travel for the sake of travel itself&rdquo; just seems wrong. How much can you really experience other cultures when you visit 193 countries before the time you are 35?</p>

<p>Chris even directly refers to his &ldquo;amazon.com reviews&rdquo; for the book which comes across as extremely tacky.</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;I&#8217;ll deserve one-star reviews on Amazon.com&#8230;</blockquote>


<p>and</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;Amazon.com reviewers, here is your chance to nail me&#8230;</blockquote>


<p>Chris general view on investing and saving money is dismissive and considered to be an unnecessary delaying of gratification. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have &lsquo;struck it rich&rsquo; in the blogging popularity contest and gotten book deals out of it. In this respect I think his views are irresponsible and dangerous.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to read his take on how our work effects other people.  I completely agree that the world is not a zero sum game. Success shouldn&rsquo;t come at the cost of someone else.  The most rewarding work is in fact that which helps others.</p>

<p>The book is short and its an easy read. I finished it in a couple of sittings. I agree with and try to follow most of the principles set forth in the book, but I did not like they way they are presented. Nothing is presented that can&rsquo;t be read for free on hundred of travel and entrepreneurial blogs.</p>

<p>The Art of Non-Conformity was unfortunately a let down and not one I would recommend to anyone else.</p>

<p>This was the first fiction I&rsquo;ve read in a very long time. Well that is not entirely true, I halfheartedly attempted to read &ldquo;A Game of Throne&#8221;s but only made it 60% of the way through. Speaking of which that book is long, way too long.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t put the darn book down. If it weren&rsquo;t for those pesky responsibilities I could have read the entire thing in one sitting.</p>

<p>Each chapter is dedicated to a different character. At first the characters and chapters seem fairly independent of each other. Slowly there stories are naturally wound together. I knew this going into the book (I really have to stop reading so many reviews before starting a book and spoiling half the fun) and was  wary it would lead to a fragmented, poorly developed story. I&rsquo;m a big fan of deep character development. Fortunately the stories tie together nicely.</p>

<p>It is easy to read and the story really drew me in. I almost wish the book was longer so it wouldn&rsquo;t have ended so soon but I guess its better to end on a high note before the reader loses interest.</p>

<p>There is not much else I have to say. Just a thoroughly enjoyable novel.</p>

			First They Killed My Father: Book #3</a>

<p>Read: July 15 &ndash; 19, 2013</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-They-Killed-Father-Remembers/dp/0060856262">Direct Amazon Link</a></p>

<p>I read this one quickly. I was extremely drawn in the whole time. Almost completely unaware of the events that transpired in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge this book was both riveting and educational.</p>

<p>The events that transpired at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, that led to the death of close to a quarter of Cambodia&rsquo;s population were devastating and this book does an excellent job at bringing them to light.</p>

<p>The entire book is written as a narrative in the voice of the author as a child (she was 5 when the events start). I personally found this choice to be perfect for myself as a reader. It personalizes the events and you can&rsquo;t help but feel as if you are there experiencing everything as well. The story is truly devastating.</p>

<p>The one criticism I have is in regards to the author&rsquo;s choice to write it in the voice of her as a child (yes, I know I just said it was a good choice, but hear me out). The days and events are described in such detail that it seems to me to be impossible that she would be able to remember that many things as  five to nine year old child. Plus its well documented how sketchy our memories are from traumatic experiences. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how much of the story has been &lsquo;dramatized&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Other than that it was an excellent book. If I struggle to put a book down its definitely a good sign, and this was definitely one of those.   Even though the tone throughout the book is one of hope, be warned that it is very depressing and sad at times.</p>
